In my various roles I have been responsible for driving and shipping a significant amount of content and software.

Here are some fun projects I play around with:

*   [The Hacker's Diet for Windows Phone](https://github.com/wadewegner/TheHackersDiet-WindowsPhone): This application is (for the time being) a proof-of-concept application that uses concepts from [The Hacker's Diet](http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/) to explore web services provided by the [Parse platform](https://parse.com/).

*   [The Flatterist SMS](https://github.com/wadewegner/FlatteristSMS): This application works with [The Flatterist](http://www.flatterist.com/) from Steve Marx. Essentially, you can send a TXT message to the provided Twilio number and you'll receive a TXT message back followed by a phone call from Steve Marx. You can also send the service the phone number of a friend.

*   [Validate ACS Token with ASP.NET Web APIs](https://github.com/wadewegner/ValidateACSTokenWebAPI): This application demonstrates how to validate an ACS token in an ASP.NET Web API service. A Windows Phone client is part of the sample.
