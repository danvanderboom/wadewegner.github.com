You can literally add these libraries to your existing Windows Phone 7 applications and immediate start leveraging services such as Windows Azure storage.</li>    <li><strong>Docs</strong> – We’ve provided documentation that covers setup and configuration, a review of the toolkit content, getting started, and some troubleshooting tips.</li>    <li><strong>Dependency Checker</strong> – As you’ve come to expect and love, we provide a full dependency checker to ensure that you have all the bits required in order to successfully use the toolkit.</li>    <li><strong>Project Templates</strong> – We have built VSIX (which is the unit of deployment for a Visual Studio 2010 Extension) files that create project templates that make it easy for you to build brand new applications.</li>    <li><strong>Samples</strong> – We have a sample application that fully leverages the toolkit, both available in C# and VB.NET.&#160; The sample application is also built into one of the two project templates created by the toolkit.</li> </ul>  <p>It’s easy to get started.</p>  <ol>   <li>Head over to <a title="http://watoolkitwp7.codeplex.com/" href="http://watoolkitwp7.codeplex.com/">http://watoolkitwp7.codeplex.com/</a> and download the latest package named <strong>WAZToolkitForWP7.exe</strong>.&#160; This file is a self-extracting executable, and will unpack the files on your disk.&#160; </li>    <li>Your first step is to run <strong>WAZToolkitForWP7.exe</strong>.&#160; <strong>Accept</strong> the License Agreement (standard MS-PL) and click <strong>Install</strong>.&#160; Nothing is registered or installed on the O/S, so it makes it extremely easy to upgrade or remove.      <br /><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 10px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2011/03/image4.png" width="539" height="301" /></li>    <li>Your next step is to run <strong>Setup.cmd</strong>.&#160; This launches the configuration wizard that will check prerequisites and install new project templates.&#160; Walk through the wizard and install any missing software.&#160; Please note that “Visual Basic for the Windows Phone Developer Tools RTW” is optional and not required.</li>    <li>Once the dependency checker has completed, the Visual Studio Extension Installer will attempt to install the <strong>Windows Azure Toolkit for WP7</strong> – make sure to click <strong>Install</strong>.&#160; This process runs the VSIX file that creates the two project templates.</li>    <li>You can now close the wizard.</li> </ol>  <p>That’s it – you now have the toolkit setup and installed on your machine.</p>  <p>Head to <strong>Visual Studio</strong> and select <strong>File</strong> –&gt; <strong>New</strong> –&gt; <strong>Project</strong>.&#160; Select the <strong>Visual Studio</strong> –&gt; <strong>Cloud</strong> templates.&#160; You will now see two new templates installed: <strong>Windows Phone 7 Cloud Application</strong> and <strong>Windows Phone 7 Empty Cloud Application</strong>.&#160; These project templates provide you with an out-of-the-box (don’t you love that phrase) experience for creating Windows Phone 7 application that use services running in Windows Azure.</p>  <p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2011/03/image5.png" width="619" height="311" /></p>  <p>Click <strong>OK</strong> and create a new project.</p>  <p>A new project wizard will ask you for your Windows Azure storage account information.&#160; You can choose to either enter production storage account information or choose to use the local storage emulator – for your first time I’d recommend using the local storage emulator.</p>  <p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2011/03/image6.png" width="416" height="166" /></p>  <p>After you click <strong>OK</strong> your new solution is created for you.&#160; This solution includes three projects that provide you with the Windows Phone 7 client already configured to use Windows Azure storage and compute services and all the services used by the phone client in a Windows Azure web role project.</p>  <p>Simply hit <strong>F5</strong> to build and run.&#160; Your phone application will launch in the Windows Phone 7 emulator, and your services will run in the Windows Azure compute emulator.</p>  <p><a href="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2011/03/image7.png"><img style="background-image: none;

You can also find additional <a href="http://watoolkitwp7.codeplex.com/documentation">documentation</a> and information on getting started.</p>  <p>One final closing thought – the toolkit is not yet complete.&#160; In fact, we’ve only just started.&#160; We already have additional work underway, and we plan to have many additional drops to provide additional capabilities and functionality.&#160; For example …</p>  <ul>   <li>Notification services for Windows Phone 7 (and other devices) that run in Windows Azure</li>    <li>Support for Windows Azure queues</li>    <li>More sample applications</li>    <li>Multiple NuGet packages</li>    <li>SQL Azure support &amp; samples</li>    <li>DataMarket support &amp; samples</li> </ul>  <p>… and the list could go on and on.&#160; If you have feedback, or your own requests, please either leave a comment or send a message to waztoolkitwp7@microsoft.com.</p>  <p>I hope you enjoy!</p>
