To effectively run mobile services for mobile apps you need a platform that is responsive to a global audience and able to scale to the needs of your user base – Windows Azure provides these capabilities.</p>  <p>As part of the refresh of the <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/" target="_blank">WindowsAzure.com</a> we have also provided additional information about <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/scenarios/mobile/" target="_blank">mobile scenarios</a> – it’s worth taking a look.</p>  <p>We’ve built a lot of resources that you should take a look at, including: the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=234566&amp;clcid=0x409" target="_blank">Windows Azure Toolkit for iOS</a>, the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=234567&amp;clcid=0x409" target="_blank">Windows Azure Toolkit for Android</a>, the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=214684&amp;clcid=0x409" target="_blank">Windows Azure Toolkit for Windows Phone</a>, and a host of NuGet packages for Windows Phone and Windows Azure. All of these resources include native libraries (e.g. Objective-C for iOS and .NET for Windows Phone), sample applications, documentation, and tools. We also have a lot of videos and guides available to make the process of getting started as easy as possible.</p>  <p><strong><font size="3"><u>How can you help?</u></font></strong></p>  <p>One of my primary goals in 2012 is to continue to find and build compelling mobile applications that benefit from Windows Azure. We already have few great stories (see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/casestudies/Windows-Azure/T-Mobile-USA/Mobile-Operator-Speeds-Time-to-Market-for-Innovative-Social-Networking-Solution/4000008598" target="_blank">T-Mobile USA</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/casestudies/Windows-Azure/Red-Badger/Creative-Software-Consultancy-Uses-Cloud-Operating-System-for-Twitter-Push-Alerts/4000011213" target="_blank">Red Badger</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/casestudies/Microsoft-Visual-Studio-Team-Foundation-Server-2010/easyJet/Airline-Aims-to-Save-Millions-Shorten-Airport-Waits-with-Cloud-Based-Mobile-Services/4000010767" target="_blank">easyJet</a>, and more) but that’s only scratching the surface – we can do a lot more!</p>  <p>So, I have a few questions of you:</p>  <ul>   <li>Are you building mobile applications that use services in Windows Azure? </li>    <li>Are you looking for additional PR and opportunities to highlight your applications? </li>    <li>Have you tried any of the toolkits or NuGet packages? </li>    <li>Do you have feedback for me regarding the use of the toolkits or NuGet packages? </li>    <li>What should we do that we aren’t today? </li>    <li>Do you have an application released to a marketplace – either Windows Phone, Apple, or Android – that uses Windows Azure? </li> </ul>  <p>If you have any feedback to these questions then please contact me at <a href="mailto:wade.wegner@microsoft.com">wade.wegner@microsoft.com</a>. I want to hear from you!</p>  <p>Let’s see what we can accomplish together!</p>
