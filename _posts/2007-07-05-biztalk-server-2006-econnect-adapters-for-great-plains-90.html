<p>I've started working on a project that integrates into Great Plains 9.0&nbsp;using eConnect.&nbsp; Not having done this using BizTalk Server 2006, I thought I'd document some of my observations and the steps I took.</p>
<p>To begin, I was able to get eConnect for GP (en_econnect_for_gp.zip) through my MSDN subscription.&nbsp; If you have Great Plains 9.0, then you should be able to get your hands on this package.&nbsp; When you unzip the package, you'll notice two files:</p>
<ul>
<li>eConnectInstallAdminGuide.pdf - This is a great document that, if you are going to interact and develop with eConnect,&nbsp;I highly encourage you to read.&nbsp; There are three parts: eConnect Basics, Installation, and Administration.&nbsp; At the very least, developers should reach the first part, which includes an overview and architecture chapter.
<li>Microsoft_Business_Solutions_eConnect.msi - This is the actual installation file.&nbsp; Note: it contains MUCH more than just the BizTalk Server adapters.</li></ul>
<p>After reading through the eConnect guide, I ran the installation MSI file.&nbsp; A few highlights / comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>I chose the "Custom" setup.&nbsp; I never choose Standard or Complete.
<li>My sole purpose at this point is to install the BizTalk adapter&nbsp;with the eConnect schemas; follow the administration guide, instead of this post, if you're setting up for production.
<li>There are a lot of features, including:
<ul>
<li>BizTalk Components - both 2004 and 2006
<li>Business Objects - installs the Business Objects into SQL Server
<li>COM+ Components - installs COM components and .NET assemblies
<li>eConnect Incoming Service - incoming eConnect Win32 service
<li>eConnect Outgoing Service - outgoing eConnect Win32 service
<li>eConnect Replication Service - eConnect Win32 replication service
<li>eConnect Help - help
<li>eConnect Samples - .NET and VB6 examples
<li>Queue Control - view documents in MSMQ queue
<li>Schemas - eConnect XSD and XDR schemas</li></ul>
<li>Not knowing any better, I decided to only include the following features:
<ul>
<li>BizTalk Components
<li>eConnect Help
<li>eConnect Samples
<li>Schemas</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Once you have installed eConnect 9.0, you must still install the adapters for BizTalk Server.&nbsp; Browser to the following folder: <font face="Courier New">C:Program FilesMicrosoft Great PlainseConnect9BizTalkBizTalk 2006 </font><font face=ta>(obviously, choose <font face="courier n">BizTalk 2004</font> if&nbsp; you are using 2004).&nbsp; Fro</font>m here you can run the <font face="Courier New">BTS_eConnectAdapter.msi</font> file and install the BizTalk Server 2006 adapter.</p>
<p>Once the installation for the adapter is complete, make sure you update your platform settings and add the adapter.&nbsp; Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <font face="Courier New">BizTalk Server 2006 Administration Console</font>.
<li>Go to BizTalk Group -&gt; Platform Settings -&gt; Adapters.
<li>Right-click the Adapters folder, and select New -&gt; Adapter.
<li>Enter a name for the adapter (e.g. eConnect) and select the "Dynamics GP eConnect" adapter from the adapter list.
<li>Click OK.&nbsp; Make sure you restart your host instances.</li></ol>
<p>Pretty simple and straightforward.</p>
<p>Now, browse to the following folder: <font face="courier new">C:Program FilesMicrosoft Great PlainseConnect9XML Schemas</font>.&nbsp; Here you will notice all the XDR and XSD schemas.&nbsp; In particular, the "Incoming XSD Individual Schemas" and the "Incoming XSD Schemas" folders.&nbsp; The first has every schema in an individual XSD, whereas the second has them all in an eConnect.xsd file.&nbsp; Depending on you circumstances, you can import these schemas into your BizTalk projects, so that you can utilize them in Orchestrations, maps, or whatever else you choose.&nbsp; Additionally, once you deploy your projects assemblies, the schemas will be available within your BizTalk solution.</p>
<p>And finally, one other folder you may want to look at is <font face="Courier New">C:Program FilesMicrosoft Great PlainseConnect9XML Sample DocumentsIncoming</font>.&nbsp; This folder has a number of sample XML documents that you can use for testing.&nbsp; VERY useful stuff here!</p>
<p>Just a few things I've learned and observed while getting all this configured.&nbsp; I'm sure I'll post more as I continue to use the eConnect adapter.</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>
