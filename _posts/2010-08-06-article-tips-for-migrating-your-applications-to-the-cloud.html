<p>I had the great pleasure of co-authoring an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff872379.aspx" target="_blank">article on application migration to Windows Azure</a> for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/default.aspx" target="_blank">MSDN Magazine</a> with my friend George Huey, creator of the <a href="http://sqlazuremw.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">SQL Azure Migration Wizard</a>.&#160; This article stems from our work helping dozens of customers – both small and big – migrate their existing applications to run in the cloud.</p>  <p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff872379.aspx"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Tips for Migrating Your Applications to the Cloud" border="0" alt="Tips for Migrating Your Applications to the Cloud" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2010/08/image1.png" width="183" height="246" /></a> </p>  <p>(Ours is the second down on the left.)</p>  <p>While this article is by no means exhaustive, we did try to explain some of the common patterns and scenarios we faced when helping customers migrate their applications into Windows Azure.&#160; I hope you find it valuable.</p>
