<p>Many applications require (or should have) direct access to the Windows Console, rather than a session on the the Windows Server.&nbsp; I encounter these kind of problems often, as I do all my development on virtual machines (running on Virtual Server 2005 R2) and use Remote Desktop to connect.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish this, call the Remote Desktop application with the following command:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px;">
<p><font face="Courier New">mstsc /console</font></p></blockquote>
<p>This will attach the Remote Desktop application directly to the system console, preventing any issues that can result from attaching to a session.</p>
<p>If you use a short-cut to connect to Remote Desktop, rather than the command line, just choose the short-cut's link, and add "/console" to the target.</p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>
