<p>It's often nice, while working with BizTalk (or any other MS product, for that matter) to have UDL files available to allow you to quickly setup your connections to various databases.&nbsp; A UDL file is essentially a file that saves connection information, making it available for future use.</p>
<p>To create a UDL file, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a folder (or use the desktop) and create a new text file (right-click --&gt; New --&gt; Text Document).
<li>Rename the extension from ".txt" to ".udl".&nbsp; Ignore the warning message.
<li>Double-click the new UDL file.
<li>Configure your database connection settings.

<li>Once you've been able to successfully test your connection, click the OK button.</li></ol>
<p>That's it!&nbsp; It's that simple!&nbsp; Now your UDL file is available for future use.</p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>
