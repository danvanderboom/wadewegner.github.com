<p>So, I've finally joined the 21st century, and purchased a <a href="http://www.samsungblackjack.com/" target=_blank>Samsung Blackjack</a>.&nbsp; After waiting a two <em>agonizing</em> days, it finally arrived.&nbsp; Man, it's a beauty!</p>
<p><img height=488 alt="Samsung Blackjack" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/WindowsMobile5.0Development_11CC7/samsungblackjack_1.gif" width=534> </p>
<p>I'll spare you a review of all it's features (this is covered in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rls=com.microsoft%3Aen-us%3AIE-SearchBox&amp;rlz=1I7GGIG&amp;q=samsung+blackjack+reviews" target=_blank>agonizing detail elsewhere</a>), but there are a couple tidbits I'd like to share.</p>
<p>The Blackjack runs Windows Mobile 5.0 with the Messaging and Security Feature Pack.&nbsp; One of the neatest features that this supports is Exchange ActiveSync w/ Direct Push Technology.&nbsp; Fortunately, the company I work for has Exchange 2007 setup to push emails directly to smart phones, and this was the first thing I setup.&nbsp; Worked like a charm!&nbsp; Very easy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note: I know that Windows Mobile 6.0 is out.&nbsp; If you have an application that runs Windows Mobile 6.0, then good for you!&nbsp; Unfortunately, the Blackjack is still on 5.0, which is why this post is geared towards 5.0.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The second thing I looked into was how to setup a development environment that allows me to develop applications that I can deploy and run on my Blackjack.&nbsp; Turns out, it's pretty simple.</p>
<p>My searches lead me to the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=3baa5b7d-04c1-4ec2-83dc-61b21ec5fe57&amp;DisplayLang=en" target=_blank>Windows Mobile 5.0 Developer Resource Kit</a>.&nbsp; This kit contains (almost) everything you need to develop Windows Mobile 5.0 applications for a&nbsp;SmartPhone and Pocket PC.&nbsp; I suggest you review the details surrounding the resource kit, and then download it and try it yourself.</p>
<p>As I said, my goal here is to setup a development environment and deploy a <em>simple</em> application to my Blackjack.&nbsp; In order to consider this a successful test, I don't need the application to actually do anything except run.&nbsp; Here are the steps I took.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note: while this is written specifically for the Blackjack, the following steps will (largely) work for any kind of SmartPhone running Windows Mobile 5.0.</em></p></blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Install all the prerequisites.&nbsp; I already had all the required prerequisites installed (e.g. Visual Studio 2005 and ActiveSync).&nbsp; I haven't yet tried any of the optional installations.
<li>Download the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=3baa5b7d-04c1-4ec2-83dc-61b21ec5fe57&amp;DisplayLang=en" target=_blank>Windows Mobile 5.0 Developer Resource Kit</a>.&nbsp; This kit has everything you need to get going.
<li>Run the MSI and install the kit.
<li>Once the kit is installed, run the Windows Mobile 5.0 Developer Resource Kit application.&nbsp; You can run this by clicking <strong>Start</strong> --&gt; <strong>All Programs</strong> --&gt; <strong>Windows Mobile 5.0 Developer Resource Kit</strong> --&gt; <strong>Windows Mobile 5.0 Developer Resource Kit</strong>.
<li>Click <strong>Install the Developer Tools</strong> --&gt; <strong>Install the Tools</strong>, and then in the detail pane slide down and click <strong>Windows Mobile 5.0 SDK for Smartphone</strong> (or Pocket PC, if you prefer).<br /><br /><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" height=480 alt="Windows Mobile 5.0 Developer Resource Kit" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/WindowsMobile5.0Development_11CC7/image_3.png" width=613 border=0><br />
<li>This opens up File Explorer in the folder <font face="Courier New">C:Program FilesWindows Mobile 5.0 Developer Resource KitcontentDeveloper ToolsWindows Mobile 5.0 SDKs</font>.&nbsp; From here, click <font face="courier new">Windows Mobile 5.0 SDK for Smartphone.msi</font> or <font face="courier new">Windows Mobile 5.0 SDK for Pocket PC.msi</font>.
<li>Once the installation completes, Visual Studio will have been updated to include a new project type called "Windows Mobile 5.0 Smartphone" under "Visual Basic" and "Visual C#".&nbsp; Open Visual Studio 2005, and click <strong>File</strong> --&gt; <strong>New</strong> --&gt; <strong>Project</strong>.<br /><br /><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" height=421 alt="Windows Mobile 5.0 Smartphone project" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/WindowsMobile5.0Development_11CC7/image_4.png" width=613 border=0><br />
<li>Select "Device Application" and click <strong>OK</strong>.&nbsp; Yes, I know the name and location are poor.&nbsp; Change them if you want; remember, this is just a quick test/demo.
<li>The project template includes a Form1.cs file.&nbsp; The designer shows a form embedded in a phone shell.&nbsp; Drop a label on the form that says something (e.g. "Hello world!").<br /><br /><a href="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/WindowsMobile5.0Development_11CC7/image_5.png" atomicselection="true"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" height=480 alt=image src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/WindowsMobile5.0Development_11CC7/image_thumb_3.png" width=218 border=0></a> <br />
<li>Make sure your Blackjack is connected to your computer via your USB cable, and confirm that ActiveSync is able to communicate and synchronize with your Blackjack.
<li>Samsung and Microsoft lock the Blackjack phone so that applications from unsigned publishers (like us!) will not run or deploy to the Blackjack phone.&nbsp; In order to resolve this, take a look at these two discussions: <a href="http://blackjacksmartzone.spreebb.com/index.php?showtopic=13" target=_blank>Application Unlock Your Blackjack</a> and <a href="http://blogs.vertigosoftware.com/jatwood/archive/2007/01/12/Samsung_Blackjack_tips_and_tricks.aspx" target=_blank>Samsung Blackjack tips and tricks</a> (the latter has some great tips).&nbsp; I chose the method in the first link, and ran AppUnlock.cab.&nbsp; Worked great.
<li>Go to <strong>Build</strong> --&gt; <strong>Deploy DeviceApplication1</strong>.&nbsp; A dialog box asks you where to deploy your application.&nbsp; Choose <strong>Windows Mobile 5.0 Smartphone Device</strong>.&nbsp; Click Deploy.<br /><br /><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" height=299 alt="Deploy Smartphone device" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/WindowsMobile5.0Development_11CC7/image_8.png" width=459 border=0> <br />
<li>The initial deployment will push a lot of CAB files used to run your .NET application.&nbsp; Make sure you approve all these cabs from your Blackjack.&nbsp; You will only have to do this the first time.
<li>Since our application was very simple, we'll have to browse to the executable through the file explorer.&nbsp; Click <strong>Start</strong> --&gt; <strong>Applications</strong> --&gt; <strong>File Explorer</strong>.&nbsp; Browse to <font face="courier new">Program FilesDeviceApplication1</font>, and click <strong>DeviceApplication1</strong>.
<li>As we have not signed the application, you will have to confirm that you want to run the application (I'll write a post some other time explaining how to sign the application).&nbsp; Click <strong>Yes</strong> to continue.
<li>Lo and behold, our application runs and displays "Hello World!".</li></ol>
<p>Yes, a completely useless and standard example, but it does serve to highlight how easy it is to setup a development environment that can publish applications to your SmartPhone (e.g. your Blackjack).</p>
<p>Now all I need to do is figure out a useful tool to build ...</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>
