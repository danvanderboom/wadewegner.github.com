<p>I awoke to see a&nbsp;very encouraging post from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rdonovan/archive/2007/05/23/update-on-commerce-server-futures.aspx">Ryan Donovan on the future of Commerce Server</a>.</p>
<p>Some key points to take away:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft is committed to their e-commerce platform, and has no plans to roll Commerce Server into another server product (for those of you who follow, there has been a lot of speculation and rumors about Microsoft not being fully committed to Commerce Server - this really helps to dispel those rumors).</li>
<li>Microsoft plans to provide "successors for the current Commerce Server SKUs"</li>
<li>The standard support life cycle for Commerce Server 2007 ends 07/12/2011.</li>
<li>Microsoft plans to find more and better ways to align Commerce Server to major product revisions in the Windows Server, SQL Server, .NET Framework, and BizTalk Server spaces.</li>
<li>The team also plans to add incremental updates and features "on an interim a la carte basis".</li></ul>
<p>So, as I said, very encouraging.</p>
<p>Some things I'd like to see in future releases ...</p>
<ul>
<li>A fully managed stack; get rid of COM dependencies</li>
<li>Replace pipelines with Windows Workflow</li>
<li>Replace DTS tasks with SSIS</li>
<li>There's more, but it's early and my brain is&nbsp;not working yet ...</li></ul>
<p>Given the major enhancements Commerce Server 2007 has made over previous versions, I'd say we can expect to see a lot of great things from the Commerce Server team.</p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>
