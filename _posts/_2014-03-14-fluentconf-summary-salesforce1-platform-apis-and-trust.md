I had the pleasure this week to speak at O'Reilly [Fluent Conferencee](http://fluentconf.com/fluent2014) this last week. A fantastic event focused on JavaScript, HTML5, and everything related to the web.

I gave a talk entitled [Building Customer Applications Using the Salesforce1 Platform APIs](http://fluentconf.com/fluent2014/public/schedule/detail/35449). You can find my deck and all the code I wrote on my [FluentConf2014](https://github.com/wadewegner/FluentConf2014/) Github repository.

For me, the opportunity to present at Fluent Conference was timely. I left Microsoft almost exactly two years ago. It's pretty remarkable to reflect that two years ago I was on the Windows Azure team and now I'm standing in front of people talking about the Salesforce1 Platform. Not something I'd have guessed two years ago.

In the 30 minutes allocated to me, I did my best to share what I've learned about the Salesforce1 Platform over the last 3-4 months. It's my sincere hope I was successful. I'd like to use this post to summarize some of the points I made during the talk.

### Platform

My first exposure to the Salesforce1 Platform came in early 2013. For a few months I was the acting CTO of a large European travel conglomerate which was looking to transform from a traditional "brick and mortar" shop to a leader in the digital age, redefining it's relationship with it's customers. As part of this I was present during some of the initial meetings with teams from salesforce.com and heard the way they pitched their platform.

I recall the first time I heard the Salesforce team pitch the Salesforce Platform. My initial reaction was of skepticism. I heard terms like "declarative developer" and "no software" and wondered who they were kidding. The idea of developing on the Salesforce Platform was antithetical to what I thought Salesforce to represent, which at time I felt was no more than a CRM platform.

At Microsoft, where I focused on Windows Azure (soon to be renamed Microsoft Azure?) we had build a pseudo-PaaS platform and were building IaaS. With this background, I did not see how Salesforce could measure up as a platform for building applications, given their heritage as a CRM tool.

Over time, what I came to learn, is that being born as a SaaS CRM product, and providing a SaaS-based platform, is no less unreasonable than a on-line book store becoming the go-to cloud solution for the IaaS business.

Rewind to salesforce.com's beginning in 1999. From the beginning the team at salesforce.com wanted to build software-as-a-service yet, given the relative infancy of the web, there was no platform available to do it. As a company, we build the CRM product as the first foray into the SaaS world. Yet at the same time there was a concerted focus on building out the SaaS platform to allow others to build their own applications on SaaS. Thus the Salesforce Platform was born and named in June of 2003 at a launch party in NYC at the Grand Havana Club. Interestingly, this was with partners Borland, BEA, Sun, and Microsoft. At this launch party the SOAP API was announced.

I mention all of this to give you some context. If you haven't been exposed to Salesforce "the platform" then you may have some skepticism as to it's capabilities.

The first demo I gave during the talk showed
