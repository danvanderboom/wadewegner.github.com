<p>So, I was having fun building some Orchestrations and Pipelines in BizTalk 2006, when all of a sudden I started getting some awful errors when I went to deploy from Visual Studio 2005.&nbsp; Here are the errors I received:</p>
<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p><font face="Courier New">Object reference not set to an instance of an object.<br />&nbsp;<br />at Microsoft.BizTalk.Deployment.BizTalkAssembly.GetConnectedPorts(BtsCatalogExplorer explorer, String pipelineFullyQualifiedName)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; at Microsoft.BizTalk.Deployment.BizTalkAssembly.RemovePortsUsingPipelines()<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; at Microsoft.BizTalk.Deployment.BizTalkAssembly.RemovePipelines()<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; at Microsoft.BizTalk.Deployment.BizTalkAssembly.Remove()<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; at Microsoft.BizTalk.Deployment.BizTalkAssembly.RemoveNamedModule(String server, String database, String assemblyName, String assemblyVersion, String assemblyCulture, String assemblyPublicKeyToken, ApplicationLog log)<br />&nbsp;<br />Unspecified exception: "Object reference not set to an instance of an object."</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New">Failed to add resource(s). Change requests failed for some resources. BizTalkAssemblyResourceManager failed to complete end type change request. Object reference not set to an instance of an object.&nbsp;<br /></font></p></blockquote>
<p>All I did was update a pipeline that was used by an Orchestration!&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried all kinds of things to get this to work: restarted host instances, restarted the Enterprise Single Sign-On service, performed a full stop on all my applications, and even deleted all my project assemblies from the GAC.&nbsp; Nothing worked except for rebooting.</p>
<p>That is, nothing worked until I decided to actually delete the pipeline from BizTalk application.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once I manually deleted the pipeline, my deployments started working again.</p>
<p>Very strange behavior!</p>
<p>If anyone can explain to me why BizTalk behaves this way, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>
