<p>There has been some excellent activity by some heavy-weights in the Commerce Server world.&nbsp; Sadly, I haven't been contributing very much on my blog, as I am desperately trying to complete <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/2007/03/13/ProfessionalCommerceServer2007.aspx">my book</a>.</p>
<p>It started with <a href="http://www.publicvoid.dk/">Søren Spelling Lund</a>'s two-part series (and maybe more?) on what it's like developing with Commerce Server 2007.</p>
<ul>
<li><a title=http://www.publicvoid.dk/DevelopingWithMicrosoftCommerceServer2007Part1SecureByDefault.aspx href="http://www.publicvoid.dk/DevelopingWithMicrosoftCommerceServer2007Part1SecureByDefault.aspx">Developing with Microsoft Commerce Server 2007 Part 1: Secure By Default</a></li></ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In this post, Søren highlights the high-level of security that has gone into Commerce Server 2007, calling it "both a blessing and a curse."&nbsp; He attributes this to the flexibility and granularity of the security system, in addition to the complexity that comes with it.&nbsp; Commerce Server 2007 makes use of the Windows Authorization Manager for security.&nbsp; See the following links for more information: <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa480244.aspx">Developing Applications Using Windows Authorization Manager</a>, and <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms914867.aspx">Managing Authorization Policies</a>.</p>
<p>Søren also highlights the Distributed Transaction Manager and use of MSDTC and System.Transaction in the .NET Framework 2.0.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a title=http://www.publicvoid.dk/DevelopingWithMicrosoftCommerceServer2007Part2ThreeWayDataAccess.aspx href="http://www.publicvoid.dk/DevelopingWithMicrosoftCommerceServer2007Part2ThreeWayDataAccess.aspx">Developing with Microsoft Commerce Server 2007 Part 2: Three-Way Data Access</a></li></ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Søren discusses three different data access systems for Commerce Server 2007, based on the subsystem with which you're working (i.e. the Profile system, the Catalog system, and the Order system).&nbsp; Take a look at his post for the specifics.&nbsp; I would also suggest you take a look at MSDN for some additional information on <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa546089.aspx">developing with Commerce Server 2007</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not to be out-done by Søren, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/maxakbar/">Max Akbar</a> took some time out of his busy schedule to post a great article on caching and Commerce Server 2007.</p>
<ul>
<li><a title=http://blogs.msdn.com/maxakbar/archive/2007/11/22/a-few-things-you-didn-t-know-about-commerce-server-s-catalog-cache.aspx href="http://blogs.msdn.com/maxakbar/archive/2007/11/22/a-few-things-you-didn-t-know-about-commerce-server-s-catalog-cache.aspx">A Few Things You Didn't Know About Commerce Server's Catalog Cache</a></li></ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Max highlights a number of important topics, including: the Catalog cache, Web.Config settings, refreshing the cache, the cache size, the cache location, how to use your own caching.</p>
<p>As always, Max's post is a great blend of information and code snippets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tschultz">Tom Schultz</a> contributed to the discussion of caching by highlighting a mixed-authentication solution for the SiteCacheRefresh HTTP handler.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tschultz/archive/2007/11/25/sitecacherefresh-mixed-authentication-solution.aspx">SiteCacheRefresh - Mixed Authentication Solution</a></li></ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Tom shows how the SiteCacheRefresh HTTP handler provides Commerce Server with caching capabilities.&nbsp; He goes beyond this, however, when he points out that by default the ASP.NET site uses forms authentication.&nbsp; Since the web site can support either forms or windows authentication, a mixed authentication model is required.&nbsp; Tom shows you how to construct this by taking aspects of the Starter Site</p></blockquote>
<p>All in all, great stuff!</p>
