<p>If you get the following error with an HTTP send port in BizTalk 2006, you may have an authentication issue:</p>
<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>A message send to adapter "HTTP" on send port "SendPort1" with URI <a href="http://localhost/vd/BTSHTTPReceive.dll?QueryString">http://localhost/vd/BTSHTTPReceive.dll?QueryString</a> is suspended.</p>
<p>Error details: This request requires buffering data to succeed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Check the following to see if it's the source of the problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the properties of your send port.
<li>Click on "Configure..." next to your HTTP type.
<li>Choose the "Authentication" tab.
<li>Make sure your authentication is set correctly (i.e. valid username and password).</li></ol>
<p>It's best to not use anonymous authentication.&nbsp; Basic is good for development and testing, but the preferred method is either Kerberos or Single Sign-On.</p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>
