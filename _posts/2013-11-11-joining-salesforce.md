Earlier this year I started an incubation project here at [Aditi Technologies](http://www.aditi.com) to explore Salesforce and, more specifically, Force.com as a platform for building cloud applications. Today I start as a full-time employee. Funny how things turn out.

When I [left Microsoft](http://www.wadewegner.com/2012/03/leaving-microsoft/) I did so to take a shot at building products and applications for Windows Azure with a fantastic team [here at Aditi Technologies](http://www.wadewegner.com/2012/04/joining-aditi-technologies-as-chief-technology-officer/). We've done that, and more.

I'm extremely proud of what's been accomplished over the last two years. In particular, I'm proud of our product engineering team, led by [Ryan Dunn](http://dunnry.com/blog/) ([@dunnry](http://twitter.com/dunnry)). In addition to being one hell of a homebrewer, Ryan is a fantastic engineer and has built some amazing products. It's been an honor and privilege to work with him and the following engineers:

* [Raghuraman Rajagopalan](http://in.linkedin.com/in/raghurajagopalan) - Good friend and India team lead. Raghu was the first person to signup for the crazy ride on this team. Without his leadership we'd never have shipped a single product.
* [Vijaya Kumar Reddy Gajjala](http://in.linkedin.com/pub/vijaya-kumar-reddy-gajjala/11/974/647) - 
* [Sagar Matto](https://www.facebook.com/sagar.mattoo.77)
* [Brihadish Koushik](http://blog.aditi.com/author/brihadish-koushik/)
* [John Belcher](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/john-belcher/76/479/2b6)

With this team we've built a number of great services. What services have we built, you may ask?
