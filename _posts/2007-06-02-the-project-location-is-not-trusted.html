<p>Having recently purchased a new server, I found myself configuring and setting up the various virtual machines I use for software development.&nbsp; After I setup my development virtual machine, I moved some of my projects over to the D drive and double-clicked one of the project files.&nbsp; After the IDE opened up, but before the project loaded, I received the following dialog message:</p>
<p><a href="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/Theprojectlocationisnottrusted_CE6F/NotTrusted.gif" atomicselection="true"><img alt="NotTrusted" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/Theprojectlocationisnottrusted_CE6F/NotTrusted_thumb.gif" border="0" height="220" width="414"></a> </p>
<p>"The project location is not trusted.&nbsp; Running the application may result in security exceptions when it attempts to perform actions which require full trust."</p>
<p>This is something I've had to setup and configure many times, but since it's not something I do every day I had to go look up the command to add my D drive as a group with full trust.&nbsp; To accomplish this, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 -&gt; Visual Studio Tools -&gt; Visual Studio 2005 Command Prompt.&nbsp; This opens up&nbsp;a command prompt with all the Visual Studio program folders in the PATH (type "path" to see).
</li><li>Type the following command:</li></ol>
<blockquote><pre>caspol -q -machine -addgroup 1 -url file://d:/* FullTrust -name "D Drive"</pre></blockquote>
<p>That's it.&nbsp; You have now added the D drive to your&nbsp;.NET runtime security policy with the Full Trust permission set.&nbsp; You will not receive any security exceptions when running your .NET applications.</p>
<p>If you open up the .NET Framework 2.0 Configuration MMC, and browse to My Computer&nbsp;-&gt; Runtime Security Policy -&gt; Machine -&gt; Code Groups -&gt; All_Code, you will see the "D Drive" code group.</p>

<p>I hope this helps!</p>
