<p>I was performing an advanced search on <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/?tab=wb&amp;hl=en" target=_blank>Google Blog Search</a> (posts that include "commerce server 2007" over the past week) when allow of a sudden I started getting the following error:</p>
<p><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" height=202 alt="We're sorry ... but your query looks similar to automated requests from a computer virus or spyware application" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/GooglesaysWeresorry_112F5/image_1.png" width=640 border=0> </p>
<p>Que?!&nbsp; What is it with me and search engines?!</p>
<p>Something very similar happened awhile back when I was <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/2007/06/14/DoYouYahooNoCantSayThatIDo.aspx" target=_blank>searching Yahoo</a>.&nbsp; I got the infamous "error 999", which evidently is most often caused by bandwidth limiting that Yahoo! invokes to prevent <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/ct.ashx?id=a2874f4e-8f7f-4309-b2fb-94cf4e2051a4&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fDenial-of-service_attack">DoS (Denial of Service) attacks</a>&nbsp;and automated processes that overload their systems.</p>
<p>Come on now, is it too much to be able to perform some advanced searches?&nbsp; While I wasn't surprised to see this happen with Yahoo!, I've come to expect more from Google.</p>
<p>Sheesh!</p>
