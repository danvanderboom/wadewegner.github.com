<p>There's a concept in Commerce Server (and many other products, for that matter) that's important to understand.&nbsp; There are two ways to go about programming against the core systems (i.e. Catalog, Inventory, Profiles, Orders, and Marketing) in Commerce Server--InProc mode and Web Service mode.&nbsp; Vinayak, a developer on the Commerce Server team, wrote an excellent blog about this concept (last October) as it <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vinayakt/archive/2006/08/30/731135.aspx">relates to the catalog system</a>.&nbsp; There are also some great code examples.</p> <p>When you are programming with the Inproc mode, the assembly is loaded into the callers AppDomain.&nbsp; This is fine if you have the ability to run your code on the actual web server, but what if you can't?&nbsp; This is where the Web Service mode becomes useful.&nbsp; In this mode, the specific Commerce Server functionality is now available remotely via a set of system specific web services.</p> <p>So what are the differences?&nbsp; When would you use one over the other?&nbsp; Here&nbsp;are things to consider:</p> <ul> <li>Inproc mode is obviously fast than Web Server mode; if speed and load are a factor, consider using Inproc mode <li>If you performing an action from a remote machine (let's say you're using the business management system) then it makes sense to use the Web Service mode</li> </ul> <p>With regards to actual coding, the only difference between these two modes is the way in which the context object is created.&nbsp; Otherwise, the object model and methods available are identical.</p> <p>Best of luck!</p>
