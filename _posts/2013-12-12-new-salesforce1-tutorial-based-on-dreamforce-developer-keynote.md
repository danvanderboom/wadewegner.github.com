We just released a [Salesforce1 tutorial on Github](https://github.com/developerforce/demo-df13-devkeynote-s1app) that walks you though the same demo presented by [Dave Carroll](http://twitter.com/dcarroll) at the [Dreamforce '13 Developer's Keynote](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELBWQIVcfk&feature=share&list=PLScnZWsj0lrRCMuciE0La1_iKtCPt4Kka). This tutorial will enable you to build the same [Salesforce1 application](http://www.salesforce.com/salesforce1/) application built by Dave during the presentation.

This tutorial focuses on the following features of Salesforce1 applications:

* Use the [Force Command-Line Interface (CLI)](http://github.com/heroku/force) tool to manipulate metadata in Salesforce.
* Create a **Salesforce1 mobile application** using the Salesforce1 app container.
* Create **Visualforce components and pages** enabled for the Salesforce1 mobile application.
* Use **mobile cards** and create **publisher actions**.
* Create a **compact view** for the page layout that is better designed for the Salesforce1 mobile application.

To get you quickly started this tutorial provides the following resources:

1. A [set of shell scripts](https://github.com/developerforce/demo-df13-devkeynote-s1app/tree/master/assets) to populate the demo schema and data into your Salesforce organization.
2. A detailed [setup guide](https://github.com/developerforce/demo-df13-devkeynote-s1app/blob/master/SETUP.md) to get you ready.
3. A [step-by-step tutorial](https://github.com/developerforce/demo-df13-devkeynote-s1app/blob/master/DEMO.md) that walks you through the entire process.
