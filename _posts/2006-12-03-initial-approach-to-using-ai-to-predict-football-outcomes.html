<p>Note: an updated, more accurate method can be found <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/PermaLink,guid,76ca62d6-a214-450c-81fe-350bd73e4cbf.aspx">here</a>.<br /><br />Over the past few months, I have been playing around with&nbsp;artificial neural networks&nbsp;(ANNs)&nbsp;in C#.&nbsp; For those of you unfamiliar with ANNs, it is an attempt to programmatically reproduce the way the brain processes data.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Below is a simple ANN architecture:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/NeuralNetwork.png" border=0></p>
<p>On the left we have inputs (i.e. data), and on the right we have an output (i.e. the outcome).&nbsp; The middle is a layer of neurons that essentially map the inputs to the output via weights (i.e. synapses).</p>
<p>The idea is that, given enough data to "train" the neural network", you can create a neural network that is capable of predicting an outcome.</p>
<p>There are many uses for ANNs; I am attempting to see if I can build a network to accurately predict football games.</p>
<p>I've created a VERY simple ANN, and come up with the following predictions for week 13 of the NFL:</p>
<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>Arizona at St. Louis : Arizona<br />Atlanta at Washington : Atlanta<br />Dallas at N.Y. Giants : Dallas<br />Detroit at New England : New England<br />Indianapolis at Tennessee : Indianapolis<br />Jacksonville at Miami : Miami<br />Kansas City at Cleveland : Kansas City<br />Minnesota at Chicago : Chicago<br />N.Y. Jets at Green Bay : Green Bay<br />San Diego at Buffalo : Buffalo<br />San Francisco at New Orleans : New Orleans<br />Tampa Bay at Pittsburgh : Pittsburgh<br />Houston at Oakland : Oakland<br />Seattle at Denver : Seattle<br />Carolina at Philadelphia (Monday night) : Carolina</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, I don't have a lot of faith in these predictions, because my inputs only consist of the following for the first 12 weeks:</p>
<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>Away Team, Home Team, Did Away Team Win?</p></blockquote>
<p>For example, the first line of my training data looks like this:</p>
<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>17,25,0</p></blockquote>
<p>Where 17 equals Miami, 25 equals Pittsburgh, and 0 means that the away team lost.</p>
<p>The idea is that the network is built based on 12 weeks of data, and given the inputs it can predict whether or not the away team wins or loses.</p>
<p>Once all the results are in, I'll post and share how well my predictions did!&nbsp; I'd be surprised if it was more than 50% accurate.&nbsp; In the future, I plan to try to find additional pieces of data to include in the training, so that the predictions become more accurate.</p>
<p>Note: I just tested this method against week 12 results (meaning I used weeks 1 through 11, excluding week 12), and found that I was only able to get it 50% accurate ... no better than randomly choosing.</p>
