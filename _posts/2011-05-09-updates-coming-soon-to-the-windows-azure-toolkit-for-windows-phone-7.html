<p>I’ve been really pleased with our delivery cadence for the <a href="http://watoolkitwp7.codeplex.com/">Windows Azure Toolkit for Windows Phone 7</a>.&#160; We first launched (v1.0) on March 23, 2011 – this launch included VS project templates, class libraries for storage and membership services, a sample application, and documentation.&#160; We had excellent coverage by <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-delivers-toolkit-for-using-windows-azure-to-build-windows-phone-7-apps/8993">Mary Jo Foley</a>, <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2011/03/windows-azure-toolkit-phone7">InfoQ</a>, and others.&#160; On April 12, 2011—during MIX11—we shipped an update (v1.1) that provided support for <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/2011/05/using-windows-azure-for-windows-phone-7-push-notification-support/">Microsoft Push Notification Services running in Windows Azure</a> (we also shipped some bug fixes).&#160; What’s significant about the second release is that we demonstrated momentum – we want to ship early and ship often.&#160; Furthermore, we are working hard on updates—many of which are based on your feedback—and we’re getting them out as quickly as we can.</p>  <p>We want to stay as transparent as possible regarding our release plans, and consequently I’d like to tell you a bit about three significant updates coming to the next release of the Windows Azure Toolkit for Windows Phone 7.</p>  <p><strong>Windows Azure Access Control Service 2.0</strong></p>  <p>With the help and guidance of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vbertocci/" target="_blank">Vittorio Bertocci</a> (aka Captain Identity) we are introducing integration with the Access Control Service (ACS) 2.0.&#160; The current (and previous) versions of the toolkit provide a very simple ASP.NET membership store in Windows Azure Tables.&#160; With the next release the new project wizard will give you the ability to choose between ASP.NET membership and the ACS.</p>  <p><a href="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2011/05/clip_image0026.gif"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="clip_image002[6]" border="0" alt="clip_image002[6]" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2011/05/clip_image0026_thumb.gif" width="355" height="232" /></a></p>  <p>The wizard only asks for the essentials and will then configure ACS automatically for you.&#160; The result is that, after the wizard completes, you can hit F5 and run.</p>  <p>For more details on the upcoming ACS integration, take a look at Vittorio’s post: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vbertocci/archive/2011/05/09/windows-azure-toolkit-for-windows-phone-7-1-2-will-integrate-with-acs.aspx" target="_blank">Windows Azure Toolkit for Windows Phone 7 1.2 will Integrate with ACS</a>.</p>  <p><strong>More Style</strong></p>  <p>Inspired by the Metro Design Language of Windows Phone 7, we’ve significantly updated the web application UI.&#160; Take a look at the new look …</p>  <p><a href="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2011/05/image5.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2011/05/image_thumb5.png" width="504" height="331" /></a></p>  <p>… as compared to the old.</p>  <p><a href="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2011/05/image6.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2011/05/image_thumb6.png" width="504" height="329" /></a></p>  <p><strong>Support for Windows Azure Storage Queues</strong></p>  <p>One feature we “missed” in our initial releases—and to be honest it was a matter of prioritization—was support for Windows Azure storage queues.&#160; With our next release we will provide support for queues in our storage library and the sample application.</p>  <p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2011/05/image7.png" width="500" height="455" /></p>  <p>We hope that you’ll find these three updates significant and worthwhile.</p>  <p>We plan to release version 1.2 of the toolkit at TechEd North America 2011.&#160; As we are still finalizing the bits and pulling together the release, I won’t commit just yet to the exact date but I promise we’ll try to release as soon as possible.</p>
