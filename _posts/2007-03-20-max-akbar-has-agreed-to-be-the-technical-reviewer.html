<p>04/13/2008 - Please see <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/2008/04/13/UpdateOnTheCommerceServerBook.aspx">this post</a> for information regarding this book.</p>
<p>I'm excited to announce that Max Akbar, senior product manager for the Microsoft Commerce Server team, has agreed to work with me on the book <em>Professional Commerce Server 2007</em> (for WROX) as the official technical reviewer.&nbsp; This is great news, as Max has an incredible amount of knowledge and experience with the Commerce Server product, which will be invaluable as I write this book.&nbsp; I couldn't be happier!</p>
