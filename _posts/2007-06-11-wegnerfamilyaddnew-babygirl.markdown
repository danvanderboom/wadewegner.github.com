Katelyn Skye Wegner was born at 1:47 am last Friday (6/8/07), weighing 7 lbs 8 oz and measuring 20.5 inches. She has short brown hair, blue eyes, and the cutest pouty face I've ever seen. She's alert, healthy, and in reasonably good spirits given what she's been through.




Teri is well, although tired and sore. While labor was relatively short, it was intense. She did a fantastic job.
