<p>I know that <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> is nothing new and that many of you are already using it, but until recently I had managed to resist.&nbsp; However, upon joining Microsoft and getting to know my evangelist peers, I found Twitter to be a great way to both keep in touch and coordinate with my friends and coworkers.&nbsp; Furthermore, having recently moved from Colorado to Illinois, I found that Twitter is also a great way to keep in touch with distant and remote friends.&nbsp; It's great to hear what's going on with my friends, like <a href="http://blog.richfinn.net/">Rich Finn</a> and <a href="http://www.ryan.mccutchenoutpost.com/">Ryan McCutchen</a>; also, unlike instant messaging technologies, we don't have to be online at the same time. </p> <p>So, as you have probably guessed, I have started to Twitter; you can follow me at: <a href="http://twitter.com/wadewegner/">http://twitter.com/wadewegner/</a>.</p> <p>There are tons of people twittering away all day long, and one of the challenges I've had is filtering out the the noise.&nbsp; Consequently, the one bit of advice I will give to newcomers is to start slow and resist the temptation to start following hundreds of people all at once; I did this at first, and I found it overwhelming.</p> <p>As a RESTful service using simple SMS, Twitter makes it easy to interact via many different clients.&nbsp; One that I've started using on my Windows Mobile 6 device is <a href="http://www.tinytwitter.com/">TinyTwitter</a>.&nbsp; This tool allows me to read the messages of people I'm following and post updates when I'm away from my computer.</p> <p>Neat stuff.&nbsp; Try it out, and feel free to follow!</p>
