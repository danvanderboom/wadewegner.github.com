<p>Thanks to a link from <a href="http://devtalk.dk/">Joachim Lykke Andersen's DevTalk</a> blog, I learned about a new blogging tool from Microsoft called "Windows Live Writer" (beta).&nbsp; Check out the details from the <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/">Windows Live Writer team blog</a>.</p>
<p>This seems to be a great tool, and one I believe I'll use religiously.&nbsp; Check it out!</p>
