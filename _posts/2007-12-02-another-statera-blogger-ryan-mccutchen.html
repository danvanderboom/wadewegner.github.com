<p>I just recently discovered that <a href="http://www.ryan.mccutchenoutpost.com/">Ryan McCutchen</a>, a colleague of mine here at <a href="http://www.statera.com/">Statera</a>, started blogging last month.&nbsp; In this past month he has already put together a number of excellent posts <a href="http://www.ryan.mccutchenoutpost.com/">discussing MOSS from an information worker, architect, and end-user perspective</a>.</p>
<p>Two posts that jumped out at me:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ryan.mccutchenoutpost.com/PermaLink,guid,1994bd3b-f350-4088-9ba4-b63a8a7b6f8d.aspx">Starting the WSS Search Service</a> - I encountered this problem myself, recently.&nbsp; Too bad I hadn't read this post first.
<li><a href="http://www.ryan.mccutchenoutpost.com/PermaLink,guid,769f7596-e405-43cc-8dab-18b56f5de8ac.aspx">Architecture of MOSS Web Application Separation</a> - Ryan discusses the separation of web applications in MOSS (e.g. separating out team sites).</li></ul>
<p>This is definitely another blog to add to the blogroll!</p>
