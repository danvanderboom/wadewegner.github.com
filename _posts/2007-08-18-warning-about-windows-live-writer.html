<p>As those of you who subscribe to this blog's feed have noticed, a place holder record was written into my RSS feed.&nbsp; Having just reinstalled my operating system (I have switched back to Vista Business once again), I was configuring my Windows Live Writer for this blog.&nbsp; If you click View --&gt; Update Weblog Style you will be asked the following:</p> <p><a href="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/WarningaboutWindowsLiveWriter_8913/image.png" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="109" alt="Allow Writer to Create a Temporary Post?" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/WarningaboutWindowsLiveWriter_8913/image_thumb.png" width="240" border="0"></a> </p> <p>Just say No!</p> <p>If you click Yes it will post the following placeholder on your blog.&nbsp; And, while it is able to delete it successfully (meaning it won't show up when you browse your blog), you will have problems getting it out of your RSS feed.</p> <blockquote> <p>This is a temporary post that was not deleted. Please delete this manually. (79142faa-4883-4d2a-bb80-daabb3ef865c)</p></blockquote> <p>Pretty annoying.&nbsp; I'm still trying to figure out how to get rid of it.&nbsp; It no longer exists in my blogs contents, yet I can't seem to get it out of my feed (which is managed by Feedburner). <p>I'll post an update if I figure it out. <p>Just be warned!!</p>
