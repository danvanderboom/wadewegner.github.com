<p><a href="http://windowsphone.wordpress.org/"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 5px 0px 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" align="left" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2010/12/image9.png" width="244" height="77" /></a> </p>  <p>This application looks pretty awesome. In addition to giving me the ability to post to my blog directly from my Windows Phone, it looks like I can also: create &amp; edit pages, moderate comments, and review my blog statistics (not that it’s impressive).</p>  <p>I’ve been very happy with the applications hitting the Windows Phone Marketplace – just last week I discovered an application to help me <a href="http://www.whsphone.com/">manage my Windows Home Server from the phone</a>.&#160; What’s next?</p>  <p>Definitely try it out the WordPress application; get more information at: <a href="http://windowsphone.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">http://windowsphone.wordpress.org/</a></p>
