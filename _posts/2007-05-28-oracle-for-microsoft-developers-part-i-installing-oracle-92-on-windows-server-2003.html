<p>There comes a time in every Microsoft developers life that&nbsp;he/she will have to work with an Oracle database.&nbsp; I hope that you find this to be a good experience; my experiences have thus far been a mixed bag, mostly because of my own ignorance.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I've picked up a few things here and there, and figured that it would be worthwhile to post some of the top tips and tricks I've learned over the years.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to discuss how to setup an Oracle database server.&nbsp; I am going to follow-up with a post on&nbsp;how to create&nbsp;an&nbsp;Oracle database.&nbsp; I use those terms loosely, because the terminology within the Oracle world is different from the SQL Server world.&nbsp; I promise I'll do my best to get it right,&nbsp;but chances are I'll make a mistake or two - please feel free to point out my gaffes.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, let's see go through the steps needed to install Oracle 9.2 (sorry, I don't have 10+) on Windows Server 2003 32-bit (note: there are many differences between 32-bit and 64-bit Windows, and my experience has shown that the following steps will not work in 64-bit Windows.&nbsp; Perhaps I'll follow-up in the future if I figure out how to get it to work ...)</p>
<ol>
<li>Secure a copy of Oracle 9.2.&nbsp; I assume that you have a copy available through work.
<li>Start the Oracle Universal Installer.&nbsp; Click the Next button.<br /><br /><img src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/01.gif" border=0><br />
<li>Confirm the installation destination (you'll need at least 3 GBs available for the installation) and click Next.<br /><br /><img src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/02.gif" border=0><br />
<li>Select "Oracle9i Database 9.2.0.1.0", and click Next.<br /><br /><img src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/03.gif" border=0><br />
<li>Select "Enterprise Edition", and click Next.&nbsp; (Why?&nbsp; Well, I don't have any compelling reason here - it's just what I've used to get things working ...)<br /><br /><img src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/04.gif" border=0><br />
<li>Select "General Purpose", and click Next.<br /><br /><img src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/05.gif" border=0><br />
<li>Leave the Port Number as 2030, and click Next.<br /><br /><img src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/06.gif" border=0><br />
<li>Define the Global Database Name.&nbsp; I choose "orcl",&nbsp;but feel free to choose whatever.&nbsp; Make sure that the SID is unique - it's probably easiest to make it the same value as the Global Database Name.&nbsp; Click Next.<br /><br /><img src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/07.gif" border=0><br />
<li>Specify the Directory for Database Files.&nbsp; I choose to leave the default value.&nbsp; Click Next.<br /><br /><img src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/08.gif" border=0><br />
<li>Unless you have a reason to change it, leave the "default character set" selected, and click Next.<br /><br /><img src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/09.gif" border=0><br />
<li>On the Summary screen, click Install.&nbsp; This installation process will take a little while.&nbsp; Be patience.&nbsp; Read one of my other posts, while you're waiting.<br /><br /><img src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/10.gif" border=0><br />
<li>The next screen to appear is the Database Configuration Assistance.&nbsp; On this screen, specify the SYS and SYSTEM passwords.&nbsp; Do NOT click OK yet.<br /><br /><img src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/11.gif" border=0><br />
<li>Before you click OK, click the Password Management Button.&nbsp; Specify passwords for SYS, SYSTEM, and DBSNMP (SCOTT too, if you'd like).<br /><br /><img src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/12.gif" border=0><br />
<li>Once you get to the End of Installation, click Exit.<br /><br /><img src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/13.gif" border=0><br />
<li>After you click Exit, the Oracle Enterprise Management Console will start.&nbsp; Check and make sure you can log into your Oracle database server by expanding databases, right-click ORCL (or whatever you called it) and click Connect.&nbsp; Enter the "system" Username, and change Connect as from "Normal" to "SYSDBA".&nbsp; Click OK.<br /><br /><img src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/14.gif" border=0><br />
<li>If you were able to successfully connect to the Oracle database server, then restart Windows.&nbsp; There's a number of reasons to do this, including updates to the PATH environment variable.</li></ol>
<p>And that's it!</p>
<p>Now, I realize that this installation procedure pretty much accepts the defaults, and clicks next.&nbsp; However, at least you have the benefit of knowing that this procedure does work, and will prepare you for the next step: configuring Oracle databases, tablespaces, users, and user access.</p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>
