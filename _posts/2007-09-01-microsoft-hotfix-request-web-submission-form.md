Lately it seems that I have had to acquire a lot of hotfixes for Microsoft products. Unfortunately, most of the KB articles don't provide a link to the hotfix, but instead ask you to contact Microsoft Support (via phone) to acquire the hotfix. Kind of a pain!

Fortunately, my friend [Rich Finn](http://blog.richfinn.net/) just passed along this useful link:

[Hotfix Request Web Submission Form](https://support.microsoft.com/contactus2/emailcontact.aspx?scid=sw;en;1410&WS=hotfix)

Very useful ... no longer will I have to reach out an contact individual escalation engineers I've worked with in the past. <sheepish grin>
