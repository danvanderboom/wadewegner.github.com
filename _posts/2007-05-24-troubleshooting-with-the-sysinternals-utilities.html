<p>As a consultant, I often have to spend a great deal of time diagnosing issues that are confronting my clients.&nbsp; Over the years I've used some of the tools available from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/default.mspx">Sysinternals</a>, but I honestly never put a lot of energy or time into really learning to use them.&nbsp; On my most recent project, however, I've found them to be tremendously helpful, and I'm now a confirmed believer!</p>
<p>There are a number of useful tools available, and I don't profess to have used&nbsp;or mastered them all.&nbsp; There are a few, however, that I strongly encourage you to familiarize yourself with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/ProcessesAndThreads/processmonitor.mspx">Process Monitor</a> - This montioring tool monitors the file system, Registry, processes, threads, and DLL activity in real-time.&nbsp; Ever need to track down where data is getting written?&nbsp; Ever wonder why you try to write or read from the Registry and receive errors?&nbsp; This utility will help you track that down.&nbsp; Process monitor is a combination of two older tools (Filemon and Regmon), and adds a whole slew of additional features such&nbsp;as rich and non-destructive filtering, comprehensive event properties such session IDs and user names, reliable process information, full thread stacks with integrated symbol support for each operation, simultaneous logging to a file, and more.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/Security/ProcessExplorer.mspx">Process Explorer</a> - Find out what files, registry keys and other objects processes have open, which DLLs they have loaded, and more. This utility will even show you who owns each process.&nbsp; This tool is excellent for tracking down programs or processes that have locked files and directories.&nbsp; It also has some powerful search capability that shows you which processes have handles opened or DLLs loaded.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/Miscellaneous/BlueScreen.mspx">BlueScreen Screen Saver</a> - Okay, so this isn't a monitoring tool, but it's part of the Sysinternals suite and it's great!&nbsp; Just load this up as the screen saver for your favorite person at work, sit back, and enjoy the show!</li></ul>

<p>Take the time to explore the various tools that are available on the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/default.mspx">Sysinternals</a> Web site.&nbsp; There are a lot of tools that will make debugging and problem solving less of a hassle.</p>
