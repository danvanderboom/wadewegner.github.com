<p>Katelyn Skye Wegner was born at 1:47 am last Friday (6/8/07), weighing 7 lbs 8 oz and measuring 20.5 inches.&nbsp; She has short brown hair, blue eyes, and the cutest pouty face I've ever seen.&nbsp; She's alert, healthy, and in reasonably good spirits given what she's been through.</p>
<p>Teri is well, although tired and sore.&nbsp; While labor was relatively short, it was intense.&nbsp; She did a fantastic job.</p>
