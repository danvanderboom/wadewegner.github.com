<p>As a native Illinoisan, I know that the <a href="http://www.explorechicago.org/city/en/things_see_do/event_landing/special_events/mose/taste_of_chicago.html">Taste of Chicago</a> is a big deal!&#160; It is the largest outdoor food and music festival in the world, and is attended by more than 3 million people each year.&#160; If you like food and music, this is a festival for you!</p>  <p><a href="http://www.westmonroepartners.com/"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 5px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="West Monroe Partners" border="0" alt="West Monroe Partners" align="right" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2009/10/image19.png" width="242" height="53" /></a>This past year, the City of Chicago needed to quickly build out an interactive map for the event – and when I say quickly, I mean it.&#160; They needed an interactive mapping experience built and deployed in less than 10 days.&#160; To help make this a reality, the City of Chicago turned to a very capable Microsoft partner, <a href="http://www.westmonroepartners.com/">West Monroe Partners (WMP)</a>, for assistance.&#160; </p>  <p>The challenges here were pretty clear:</p>  <ul>   <li>Build an interactive and immersive website in less than 10 days.</li>    <li>The website needed to scale massively for the event, but once the event was over they wanted to scale the infrastructure down.</li>    <li>WMP wanted to leverage their existing skills and tools.</li> </ul>  <p>WMP proposed the following – an immersive <a href="http://silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a> Deep Zoom experience running on <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/">Windows Azure</a> (if you’re not familiar with Deep Zoom, take a look at the <a href="http://memorabilia.hardrock.com/">Hard Rock memorabilia site</a>).&#160; You can still visit the <a href="http://tasteofchicago09.cloudapp.net/">Taste of Chicago interactive map</a> – check it out:</p>  <p><a href="http://tasteofchicago09.cloudapp.net/"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Taste of Chicago interactive map" border="0" alt="Taste of Chicago interactive map" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2009/10/image20.png" width="492" height="439" /></a> </p>  <p>The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/">Windows Azure Platform</a> – which I’ve discussed many times on my blog – is Microsoft’s cloud platform.&#160; It is comprised of the following: Windows Azure, an operating system as a service; SQL Azure, a fully relational database in the cloud; and .NET Services, consumable web-based services that provide both secure connectivity and federated access control for applications.</p>  <p>The City of Chicago’s decision to go with Silverlight and Windows Azure provided a host of very tangible benefits, including:</p>  <ul>   <li>Fast, cost-effective development</li>    <li>Immediate customer satisfaction</li>    <li>Increased agility</li>    <li>Dynamic user experience</li> </ul>  <p>In fact, this is broken down in detail in the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/casestudies/Case_Study_Detail.aspx?casestudyid=4000004836">Taste of Chicago case study with WMP and the City of Chicago</a>.</p>  <p>Additionally, Erik Brown – technical lead at WMP – spoke to Microsoft about their <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Abe+Pachikara/SI-WMT-Handles-Client-Need-in-10-Days-Using-Azure/Default.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0">experience building the interactive map in Silverlight and on Windows Azure</a>.&#160; I definitely recommend you take a look:</p>  <p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Abe+Pachikara/SI-WMT-Handles-Client-Need-in-10-Days-Using-Azure/Default.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Windows Azure" border="0" alt="Windows Azure" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2009/10/image21.png" width="492" height="372" /></a> </p>  <p>A really great story about how a capable partner can leverage innovative technology to not only dazzle a customer, but provide a valuable service for millions of users.</p>  <p>I hope this helps!</p>
