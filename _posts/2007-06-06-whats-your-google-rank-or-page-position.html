<p>I often find myself curious as to what my rank/position on Google is, given a set of keywords.&nbsp; For example, I know that if I search on my name <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Wade+Wegner">"Wade Wegner"</a> this blog comes up second (my personal site being first).&nbsp; However, I sometimes wonder where my blog falls for other keywords, such as "commerce server 2007" or "biztalk server 2006".</p>
<p>So, I wrote this little tool to tell me!</p>
<p><iframe src="http://apps.wadewegner.com/googlewebrank_v1_0.aspx" width=530 height=300>
</iframe></p>
<p>This tool allows you to specify your URL (e.g. "<a href="http://www.wadewegner.com">http://www.wadewegner.com/</a>") and some keywords (e.g. "commerce server 2007") and tells you what number you are.&nbsp; Currently, I have it scan only the first 1000 Google entries.</p>
<p>Useful, yes?</p>
<p>I realize it's a simple interface, but I just quickly slapped it together.</p>
<p>Any one know if this violates any of Googles terms of use?&nbsp; I hope not!</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
