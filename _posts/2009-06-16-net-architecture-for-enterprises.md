Yesterday I gave a talk on .NET architecture to a very large customer here in Illinois (in case you’re interested, I had to drive down to Bloomington, IL. to visit them).  The description of the talk was pretty bland – “Overview of application architecture for medium to large scale applications.” – so I tried to spice it up a bit.  Here’s the presentation:


[.NET Architecture for Enterprises](http://www.slideshare.net/wwegner/net-architecture-for-enterprises?type=powerpoint)


Ultimately, my goal in this talk was to address the following:



	
  * Provide an introduction to software architecture – i.e. the practice of architecture, the role of an architect, architecture patterns & anti-patterns, methodologies, and the like – to developers that typically live in a world of software implementation.

	
  * Explore the practical aspects of applying architectural practices in .NET.


I had a lot of fun preparing for this talk, and I sincerely hope that the audience found it valuable.  I hope to eventually record this as a webcast and then break off into more specific topics that dig into different areas.
