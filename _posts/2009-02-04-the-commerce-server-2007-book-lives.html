<p>In fact, not only is it alive, but it’s thriving!</p> <p>Please take a look at an announcement recently made by Glen (Software) Smith announcing that <a href="http://www.software-smith.com/blog20080901.htm">the Commerce Server 2007 book is finished</a>.&nbsp; You may (or may not) recall that this book was originally going to be published by Wiley (aka Wrox), but that it was <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/2008/04/13/UpdateOnTheCommerceServerBook.aspx">cancelled for a number of reasons</a>.&nbsp; Consequently, efforts on the book essentially stalled until Glen stepped up last fall and volunteered to see it through fruition.&nbsp; I am extremely grateful for all his hard work.</p> <p>Glen has done a fantastic job taking the existing content I created (along with input from Tom Schultz, Ryan Donovan, Kevin Kraus, Brad Bont, David Hargis – and even Max Akbar) and extend it with additional content.&nbsp; Furthermore, I’m very excited that he’s currently refreshing the book so that it contains information on Commerce Server 2009 as well – very exciting!&nbsp; Take a look at the TOC (note: this may change based on the refresh for Commerce Server 2009):</p> <blockquote> <p><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp; i. Introduction<br />Part I: Commerce Server Primer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Getting Started<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 The Commerce Server Architecture<br />Part II - Commerce Server Overview&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 The Catalog System<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 The Inventory System<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 The Orders System<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 The Profiles System<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 7 The Marketing System<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 8 The Commerce Server Adapters for BizTalk Server<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 Commerce Server Staging<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 The Data Warehouse Analytics System<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 11 The Business Processing Pipeline System<br />Part III: Developing with Commerce Server&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 12 Commerce Server Development<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 13 Developing with the Catalog System<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 14 Developing with the Inventory System<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 15 Developing with the Orders System<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 16 Developing with the Profile System<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 17 Developing with the Marketing System<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 18 The Business Management Applications<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 19 Extending the Data Warehouse and SQL Reporting Services<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 20 Commerce Server Integration<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 21 Operational Management<br />Part IV: Commerce Server Production Architectures&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 22 Application Architectures for Production</font></p></blockquote> <p>I know you all have questions about the cost and availability of this book.&nbsp; When I have more information, I will post it.&nbsp; For now, if you have questions, please feel free to email me (through my blog here) or reach out to Glen at his blog (<a title="http://www.software-smith.com/" href="http://www.software-smith.com/">http://www.software-smith.com/</a>).</p> <p>Looking back at my first announcement regarding <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/2007/03/13/ProfessionalCommerceServer2007.aspx">Commerce Serve 2007</a>, I’m struck by the fact that it’s been almost two years – amazing.&nbsp; What’s more amazing is that today there <strong>STILL</strong> isn’t a definitive book on building e-commerce applications with Commerce Server 2007 (or 2009, for that matter).&nbsp; I think you all will be very happy with this book.</p> <p>Hope this helps!</p>
