<p>I often hear from people that they want to try out the Virtual Machine Role (VM Role for short) but cannot find it in the <a href="http://windows.azure.com/">Windows Azure portal</a> and don’t see the option in Visual Studio.&#160; This is because it is still in beta and requires you to request access—and receive acceptance—into the program.&#160; Fortunately, we make it very easy to get accepted – essentially request access, wait a week, and you’re in.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>If you don’t have access to Windows Azure, I <strong>highly</strong> recommend you change that with the <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/2011/03/try-out-windows-azure-with-a-free-pass/">Windows Azure Pass</a> – it lasts for 30 days, it’s free, and it <strong>doesn’t require a credit card</strong>.&#160; I’ve previously posted instructions on <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/2011/03/try-out-windows-azure-with-a-free-pass/">setting up the Windows Azure Pass</a>.&#160; This is a painless and easy way to try out the platform.</p> </blockquote>  <p>To request access to the beta simply follow these steps:</p>  <ol>   <li>Browse to <a href="http://windows.azure.com/"><strong>http://windows.azure.com/</strong></a>.</li>    <li><strong>Login</strong> with your Windows Live account.</li>    <li>In the left menu, select <strong>Beta Programs</strong>.&#160; This will load the Beta Program page in the main frame.      <br /><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 10px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2011/03/image.png" width="120" height="82" /></li>    <li>You should see (at the time of this post) two available beta programs – <strong>Windows Azure Connect</strong> and <strong>VM Role</strong>.&#160; On the right, select the checkbox for VM Role (you may as well do it for Windows Azure Connect while you’re at it).      <br /><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 10px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2011/03/image3.png" width="587" height="198" /></li>    <li>Click the <strong>Apply for Access</strong> button.</li> </ol>  <p>After you apply your status will change to <strong>Pending</strong>.&#160; It generally takes about a week to get accepted into the beta program.&#160; Unfortunately, there’s nothing I can do to accelerate the process.</p>  <p>Once you’re accepted your status will change to <strong>Active</strong> and you’ll receive an email with additional instructions on how to get started – be on the lookout!&#160; One indicator that you’re actively in the beta program is you’ll see <strong>VM Images</strong> in your list.</p>  <p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2011/03/image2.png" width="126" height="131" /></p>  <p>I hope this helps, and enjoy the VM Role!</p>
