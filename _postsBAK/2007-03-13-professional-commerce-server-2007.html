<p>I have just closed a deal with Wrox (<a href="http://www.wrox.com/">http://www.wrox.com/</a>)&nbsp;to write a book on Commerce Server 2007!</p> <p>This book will be part of the Professional series, and entitled <em>Professional Commerce Server 2007</em>.&nbsp; Writing begins next week, and should be completed by the end of Q3, 2007.&nbsp; It should hit store shelves some time in late 2007, early 2008.&nbsp; A long process, yet hopefully very worthwhile!</p> <p>This book will deal with advanced topics, such as:</p> <ul> <li>Best practices and development environments <li>Commerce Server core systems architecture <li>Building a Commerce Server site / using the Starter Site <li>Using the Business Management Systems <li>The Pipeline Framework <li>Web Services and SOA <li>SQL Reporting Services <li>Core systems deep dive <ul> <li>Catalog System <li>Inventory System <li>Marketing Campaigns <li>Customer and Orders Manager System</li> </ul> <li>BizTalk 2006 adapters <li>The Commerce Server 2007 MOM Pack <li>Production architecture <li>Deployment tools and methodology <li>Commerce Server staging <li>Deploying and securing the site <li>Tuning and optimizing</li> </ul> <p>Additionally, the last quarter of the book will be advanced "how-to" topics, with lots of examples.&nbsp; These are based on the most common questions and scenarios requested by companies using Commerce Server, and will take the reader from start to finish.</p> <p>I will try to periodically post information to this blog.&nbsp; Stay tuned!</p>
