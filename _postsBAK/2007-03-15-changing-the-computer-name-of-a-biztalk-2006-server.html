<p>I recently found myself in a situation where I had to change the computer name of a machine I had configured as a BizTalk 2006 server.&nbsp; The machine was actually a virtual machine that was going to be used for development, and we made numerous copies for all the developers.&nbsp; Consequently, each developer needed to have a computer with a unique name.</p> <p>After researching the appropriate way&nbsp;to do this, all I could find were very manual steps.&nbsp; For instance, here are some of the intial things I tried:</p> <p><strong>Note: I do NOT recommend using this approach.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Rename the computer <li>Add a host entry to the old computer name; add a SQL alias for the old computer name <li>Execute the following in SQL: sp_dropserver [computerName] <li>Drop and recreate all SQL logins <li>Update the following registry keys <ul> <li>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftBizTalk Server3.0AdministrationMgmtDbServer <li>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftBusinessRules3.0</li> </ul> <li>Update the following database tables <ul> <li>BizTalkHWSDb.HWS_Core <li>BizTalkMgmtDb.adm_MessageBox <li>BizTalkMgmtDb.adm_OtherDatabases <li>BizTalkMgmtDb.adm_Group <li>BizTalkMgmtDb.adm_Server <li>BizTalkMgmtDb.TDDS_Sources <li>BizTalkMgmtDb.TDDS_Destinations</li> </ul> <li>Run the following command: ssoconfig -setdb&nbsp;computerName SSODB</li> </ul> <p>While this worked, it was NOT an ideal solution.&nbsp; I still noticed a few issues in the BizTalk configuration, etc.&nbsp;</p> <p>Once I had a night to think about this, I realized that there's a MUCH easier way to go about doing this.&nbsp; Here's the process:</p> <ol> <li>Unconfigure the current BizTalk configuration via BizTalk Server Configuration.&nbsp; This essentially removes all the existing BizTalk databases. <li>Go to MSSQL, and delete all the BizTalk databases and SQL logins <li>Change the computer name, and restart. <li>Run the following two commands in MSSQL <ol> <li>sp_addserver [newComputerName] <li>sp_dropserver [oldComputerName]</li> </ol> <li>Configure a new BizTalk configuration via BizTalk Server Configuration <li>Go into BizTalk Server Administration and remove the old BizTalk group, and add the new BizTalk group.</li> </ol> <p>This solution has worked perfectly for our development environments.</p> <p>Best of luck!</p>
