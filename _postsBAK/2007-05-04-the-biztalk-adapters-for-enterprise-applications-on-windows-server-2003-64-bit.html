<p>As I mentioned in a previous blog, I've been setting up BizTalk 2006 in a 64-bit Windows Server 2003 environment.&nbsp; This BizTalk solution communicates to AS/400 and Oracle, so I've been using the Microsoft BizTalk Adapters for Enterprise Applications (for Oracle connectivity) as well as Microsoft BizTalk Adapters for Host Systems (for AS/400 DB2 connectivity).</p>
<p>Setting up these adapters has not gone extremely well in&nbsp;the 64-bit O/S (whereas a 32-bit O/S is quite simple to configure).&nbsp; I've been set back about a week because many different issues related to the 64-bit environment (and a few other issues).&nbsp; In this post, I want to explain the issues I've encountered with regards to the Oracle adapter in a Windows Server 2003 64-bit environment.</p>
<p>This post assume that you've already installed your Oracle client.&nbsp; Check out my&nbsp;post <a class=TitleLinkStyle href="http://www.wadewegner.com/PermaLink,guid,c99bc4ea-984d-418c-aff7-9462f994f0a9.aspx" rel=bookmark>Using the "ODBC Adapter for Oracle Database" in BizTalk 2006</a>&nbsp;for information on how to install the client.&nbsp; However, if you're installing on a 64-bit machine, stop after you install the client.&nbsp; The 64-bit world is quite different ...</p>
<p>1. Install the .NET Framework 1.1 and SP 1.</p>
<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>The Oracle adapter requires the .NET Framework 1.1 and SP 1.&nbsp; My 64-bit environment didn't have the .NET Framework 1.1 installed, so this was an additional step I had to take.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the easiest of all the steps I had to take ...</p></blockquote>
<p>2. Create&nbsp;the ODBC connection.</p>
<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>Turns out that you cannot simply run Data Sources (ODBC) from Administrative Tools.&nbsp; You have to run %WINDIR%SysWOW64odbcad32.exe, which invokes the 32-bit version of the Data Sources (ODBC) GUI.&nbsp; See my post <a class=TitleLinkStyle href="http://www.wadewegner.com/PermaLink,guid,9d1ef109-430a-44a6-808b-807695592583.aspx" rel=bookmark>Adding ODBC connections in Windows Server 2003 64-bit</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p></blockquote>
<p dir=ltr>3. Install the Microsoft BizTalk Adapters for Enterprise Applications.</p>
<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p dir=ltr>I only installed Oracle (r) Database.&nbsp; Surprisingly, with the .NET Framework 1.1 and SP 1 installed, this goes very well.</p></blockquote>
<p dir=ltr>4. Update registry settings for the Microsoft BizTalk Adapters for Enterprise Applications.</p>
<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p dir=ltr>Turns out that some of the registry keys that are written during the installation are wrong (or rather, they're not interpreted correctly).&nbsp; Browse to the following registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWow6432NodeMicrosoftBizTalkAdapters.&nbsp; Two of the values, InstallDir and InstallPath, need to be changed.&nbsp; Do the following:</p>
<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p dir=ltr>1. Change InstallDir from "C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft BizTalk Adapters for Enterprise Applications" to "C:Progra~2Microsoft BizTalk Adapters for Enterprise Applications".</p>
<p dir=ltr>2. Change InstallPath from "C:Program Files (x86)Common FilesMicrosoft BizTalk Adapters for Enterprise Applications" to "C:Progra~2Common FilesMicrosoft BizTalk Adapters for Enterprise Applications".</p></blockquote>
<p dir=ltr>Yes, for some reason, you have to change "Program Files (x86)" to "Progra~2", probably because the Adapter isn't written very well.&nbsp; If you don't update these registry settings, you will most likely get the following error:</p>
<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>The description for Event ID ( 0 ) in Source ( Microsoft BizTalk Adapters for Enterprise Applications ) cannot be found. The local computer may not have the necessary registry information or message DLL files to display messages from a remote computer. You may be able to use the /AUXSOURCE= flag to retrieve this description; see Help and Support for details. The following information is part of the event:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exception occurred:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error Code: 12154 (0x2f7a)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 08004 : [Oracle][ODBC][Ora]ORA-12154: TNS:could not resolve service name.</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p dir=ltr>5. Update additional registry settings to fix permission errors if you are using domain groups for authentication.</p>
<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p dir=ltr>Your domain groups will not have access to the Oracle adapter by default.&nbsp; In order to allow the runtimeagent.exe (which is the executable that is spawned and runs the Oracle adapter) to run appropriately, it needs to be able to access a registry key.&nbsp; See the following article for more information: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?id=923650">http://support.microsoft.com/?id=923650</a>.</p>
<p dir=ltr>Do the following to resolve this issue (from the article):</p>
<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p dir=ltr>1. Locate the following registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESoftwareWow6432NodeMicrosoftBizTalkAdaptersConfig</p>
<p dir=ltr>[** Thanks to <a href="http://www.soa-thoughts.blogspot.com/">Steef-Jan Wiggers</a> for noting that I forgot to display the 32-bit path in the Wow6432Node key]</p>
<p dir=ltr>2. Right-click the registry key that you located in step 1, and then click Permissions. </p>
<p dir=ltr>3. On the Security tab, click Add. </p>
<p dir=ltr>4. Type the domain group or the domain user account that is configured as the BizTalk host instance, and then click OK. </p>
<p dir=ltr>5. On the Security tab, click the domain group or the domain user account that you added in step 4, click to select the Read check box, and then click OK. </p></blockquote>
<p dir=ltr>If you don't update these registry settings, you will most likely get the following (unhelpful) error:</p>
<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p dir=ltr>"RuntimeAgent: Error trapped in constructor: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it"</p>
<p dir=ltr>Error transmitting message: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p dir=ltr>6. Update the security permissions on your Oracle folder.</p>
<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p dir=ltr>This is the most bizarre step of all, and it's not particular to the 64-bit environment.&nbsp; Oracle software requires that you give the Authenticated User privilege to the Oracle Home.&nbsp; In most cases, your Oracle agent will not be the Administrator account (or at least, I hope it's not).&nbsp; However, there seems to be an issue with the permissions associated to Authenticated Users.&nbsp; Consequently, the agent you specify to run the Oracle "runtimeagent.exe" is unable to gain access to the folder.&nbsp; You might see the following error:</p>
<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p dir=ltr>IM003 : Specified driver could not be loaded due to system error&nbsp; 5</p></blockquote>
<p dir=ltr>To resolve this problem, you have to do the following:</p>
<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">1. Log on to Windows as a user with Administrator privileges.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">2. Launch Windows Explorer from the Start Menu and and navigate to the ORACLE_HOME folder. This is typically the "Ora92" folder under the "Oracle" folder (i.e. D:OracleOra92).</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">3. Right-click on the ORACLE_HOME folder and choose the "Properties" option from the drop down list. A "Properties" window should appear.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">4. Click on the "Security" tab of the "Properties" window.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">5. Click on "Authenticated Users" item in the "Name" list (on Windows XP the "Name" list is called "Group or user names").</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">6. Uncheck the "Read and Execute" box in the "Permissions" list under the "Allow" column (on Windows XP the "Permissions" list is called "Permissions for Authenticated Users").</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">7. Re-check the "Read and Execute" box under the "Allow" column (this is the box you just unchecked).</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">8. Click the "Advanced" button and in the "Permission Entries" list make sure you see the "Authenticated Users" listed there with:</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Permission = Read &amp; Execute</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Apply To = This folder, subfolders and files</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">If this is NOT the case, edit that line and make sure the "Apply onto" drop-down box is set to "This folder, subfolders and files". This should already be set properly but it is important that you verify this.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">9. Click the "Ok" button until you close out all of the security properties windows. The cursor may present the hour glass for a few seconds as it applies the permissions you just changed to all subfolders and files.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">10. Reboot your computer to assure that these changes have taken effect.</p></blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Yes, I was in as much shock as you are.&nbsp; Uncheck a flag, and then re-check it.&nbsp; I lost almost three days because of this bug.</p></blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">That's about it!&nbsp; A series of (mostly)&nbsp;undocumented steps that are required in order to get the Oracle adapter to function in a 64-bit environment.&nbsp; Fortunately, I had some great support from the escalation engineer's with the Microsoft Product Support Services group.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">I hope this post helps someone else avoid much of the pain and agony I had to go through ...</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Best of luck!</p>
