<p>Having problems getting yourself or your team up to speed on Commerce Server?&nbsp; Want to leverage your existing skills in ASP.NET and SQL Server?</p> <p>As many of you are probably aware, good technical training resources for Commerce Serve 2007 are hard to come by.&nbsp; In no way is this meant to be a criticism of the Commerce Server product team, as they have made every effort to blog and webcast&nbsp;about technical topics and some of the newer features of Commerce Server.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there's still&nbsp;a void with regards to technical training resources (a void I hope to fill with my book <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/PermaLink,guid,96042b54-9859-4ea8-8497-5dab8033f405.aspx"><em>Professional Commerce Server 2007</em></a>).</p> <p>One thing I've noticed during my conversations with companies building Commerce Server solutions is that most companies have internal technical resources with solid skills in ASP.NET, SQL Server 2000/2005, and even BizTalk 2006.&nbsp; Companies want to leverage their existing skills, and quickly acquire the specific Commerce Server skills required to implement and develop successful systems.</p> <p>If this seems to accurately describe the situation you find youself in, please let me know at <a href="mailto:wade.wegner@gmail.com">wade.wegner@gmail.com</a>.&nbsp; If I don't have a resolution, perhaps I can find someone&nbsp;that does!</p>
