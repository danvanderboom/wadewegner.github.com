<p>Last Monday, three of us from Statera (Troy Hall, Colin McGraw, and myself) presented on the topic of Silverlight at the first MSDN Masters Series presentations in Denver, CO.&#xA0; This event was hosted by Joe Shirey, an architect evangelist for MSFT, and was geared towards technical folks at the 200-300 level.</p>  <p>We presented the following three sessions over the course of four hours:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>1. Programming Silverlight (Wade Wegner)     <br />2: ASP.NET, AJAX and Silverlight (Colin McGraw)      <br />3: Silverlight and Media (Troy Hall)</p> </blockquote>  <p>We had a good healthy attendance, and it is my hope that the topic was received well by the audience.</p>  <p>As promised, here are the slides from the presentation:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>1. <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/downloads/MSDN%20Masters%20Series%20-%20Programming%20Silverlight.pdf" target="_blank">MSDN Masters Series - Programming Silverlight.pdf</a>      <br />2. <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/downloads/MSDN%20Masters%20Series%20-%20Programming%20Silverlight.pdf" target="_blank">MSDN Masters Series - ASP.NET, AJAX, and Silverlight.pdf</a>      <br />3. <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/downloads/MSDN%20Masters%20Series%20-%20Silverlight%20and%20Media.pdf" target="_blank">MSDN Masters Series - Silverlight and Media.pdf</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>Additionally, Colin has provided the source code for the Photo Site he demonstrated in his talk:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>- <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/downloads/PhotoSite_VS2005WebSiteProject.zip" target="_blank">PhotoSite_VS2005WebSiteProject.zip</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>And lastly, here's a slide deck I used for a &quot;non-technical&quot; discussion of Silverlight:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>- <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/downloads/Silverlight%20Intro.pdf" target="_blank">Silverlight Intro.pdf</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>I hope you find these useful.&#xA0; Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.</p>
