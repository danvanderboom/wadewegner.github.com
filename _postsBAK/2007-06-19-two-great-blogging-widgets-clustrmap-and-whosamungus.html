<p>I'm finally taking the time to highlight two blogging widgets that I have been using on my blog: <a href="http://www2.clustrmaps.com/">ClustrMap</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://whos.amung.us/">whos.amung.us</a>.&nbsp; These aren't the only widgets I use, but of the half-dozen scattered throughout my blog these are (arguably)&nbsp;the least well-known (at least, I don't see them very often).</p>
<p>The first is <a href="http://www2.clustrmaps.com/">ClustrMap</a>.&nbsp; ClustrMap is a mapping&nbsp;widget that embeds itself into your blog and visually displays the location of your various visitors.&nbsp; ClustrMap provides HTML source that renders as a map, and when it loads it increments a counter and displays the locations of all the visitors to your page.&nbsp; Clicking on the map zooms to a big world map, and allows you to zoom into the continents.</p>
<p>I use this in my sidebar, toward the bottom of my blog.&nbsp; Here's what it looks like:</p>
<p><img alt="ClustrMap example" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/cluster.gif" border=0></p>
<p>It reminds me of a small-scale version of the map Google Analytics provides.&nbsp; Here's an example of the script you would embed within your HTML:</p><pre>&lt;a href="http://www2.clustrmaps.com/counter/maps.php?url=http://www.wadewegner.com"<br />  temp_href=http://www2.clustrmaps.com/counter/maps.php?url=http://www.wadewegner.com<br />  id="clustrMapsLink"&gt;</pre><pre>  &lt;img src=http://www2.clustrmaps.com/counter/index2.php?url=http://www.wadewegner.com<br />     style="border:0px;" <br />     alt="Locations of visitors to this page" <br />     title="Locations of visitors to this page" <br />     id="clustrMapsImg" <br />     onError="this.onError=null;<br />       this.src='http://clustrmaps.com/images/clustrmaps-back-soon.jpg'; <br />       document.getElementById('clustrMapsLink').href='http://clustrmaps.com'" /&gt;</pre><pre>&lt;/a&gt;</pre><font size=2>
<p>Very easy to use and setup.&nbsp; It takes about a day for it to gather enough information and draw a map, so don't expect it to work immediately.&nbsp; If you click on the map you can get a few statistic about the site.&nbsp; Here's an example:</p>
<p><img alt="ClustrMap stats" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/stats.gif" border=0></p>
<p>The second widget is </font><a href="http://whos.amung.us/">whos.amung.us</a>.&nbsp; Have you ever wanted to know how many users are reading your Web site or blog in real time?&nbsp; This widget is the answer.&nbsp; Again, they provide HTML script that you can embed within your Web site, and it renders as an image that counts the number of users on your Web site.&nbsp; Clicking on the images takes you to their Web page, which shows you exactly which pages your readers are on, as well as how long ago they arrived.</p>
<p>Here's what the widget looks like:</p>
<p><a href="http://whos.amung.us/show/ds0261t1"><img height=29 alt=counter src="http://whos.amung.us/cwidget/ds0261t1/7cbafcffffff" width=81 border=0></a></p>
<p>Here's the page that shows the URLs your readers are currently at (it's also neat that the links&nbsp;refresh themselves every few seconds):</p>
<p><img alt="whos.amung.us stats" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/links.gif" border=0></p>
<p>Also, <a href="http://whos.amung.us/">whos.amung.us</a>&nbsp;provides a functional Color Wheel that allows you to change the colors of the widget:</p>
<p><img alt="whos.amung.us color map" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/wheel.gif" border=0></p>
<p>As with ClustrMap, the code for this widget is very simple:</p><pre>&lt;a href=http://whos.amung.us/show/ds0261t1&gt;</pre><pre>  &lt;img src=http://whos.amung.us/cwidget/ds0261t1/7cbafcffffff <br />     temp_src=http://whos.amung.us/cwidget/ds0261t1/7cbafcffffff <br />     alt="counter" width="81" height="29" border="0" /&gt;</pre><pre>&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
<p>Neither of these tools, <a href="http://www2.clustrmaps.com/">ClustrMap</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://whos.amung.us/">whos.amung.us</a>, require you to setup an account or provide any personal information.&nbsp; Simply paste the HTML code into your Web page, and off you go!</p>
<p>What tools and/or widgets do you use on your blog or Web site that are useful?</p>
