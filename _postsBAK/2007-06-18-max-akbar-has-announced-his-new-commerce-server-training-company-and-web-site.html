<p>Max Akbar, Commerce Server expert and former Senior Product Manager for&nbsp;the&nbsp;Commerce Server team, has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/maxakbar/archive/2007/06/18/commerce-server-training-part-iv.aspx">announced his new training company and web site</a>.&nbsp; Training resources include video tutorials, DVDs, PowerPoint presentations, codes samples, and on-site training.&nbsp; You can find more information on his Web site at <a title=http://www.commerceservertraining.com/ href="http://www.commerceservertraining.com/">http://www.commerceservertraining.com/</a>.</p>
<p>Max recently left Microsoft to consult and train companies using Commerce&nbsp; Server.&nbsp; While this is a huge loss for Microsoft, it is a huge win for the Commerce Server community as there has been a noticeable lack of training resources available.&nbsp; Max is sure to do an excellent job filling this void.&nbsp; Additionally, Max is acting as the <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/PermaLink,guid,3c1236af-3d8f-4e64-bb30-231e7869930f.aspx">technical editor</a> on my forthcoming book <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/PermaLink,guid,96042b54-9859-4ea8-8497-5dab8033f405.aspx"><em>Professional Commerce Server 2007</em></a>.</p>
<p>Best of luck, Max!</p>
