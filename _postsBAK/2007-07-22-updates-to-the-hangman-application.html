<p>I had no idea that this game would be so popular!&nbsp; Despite the crappy graphics, it's been referred half a dozen times, and received almost 300 unique hits in the last 24-hours.&nbsp; Pretty amazing!</p>
<p>Here's the link to <a href="http://apps.wadewegner.com/hangman">Hangman</a>.&nbsp; Give it a try.&nbsp; Here's the <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/2007/07/21/HangmanApplicationBuiltOnSilverlightAndNET35.aspx">original Hangman announcement</a>.</p>
<p>There have been a few updates to the original program, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Includes the definition of the word; calls a .NET web service that parses a web response from Dictionary.com (please let me know if you find problems!)
<li>Tracks statistics (e.g. total times played, won, and lost); so far we lose a&nbsp;LOT more&nbsp;
<li>Frees the man from the noose if you win</li></ul>
<p>Yes, they're all silly little updates, but hopefully it increases the enjoyment of the game.</p>
<p>Here are a couple screen shots with the updates.&nbsp; The first one shows what happens when you die, err, lose.</p>

<p>This next one shows what happens when you win.&nbsp; Doesn't that look a lot more pleasant?</p>
<p><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" height=345 alt="Hangman; winning" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/Untitled-1.gif" border=0></p>
<p>This sure is fun stuff to play with.&nbsp; Now that I feel more comfortable with Silverlight and WPF, there are all kinds of things I'd like to write.&nbsp; It's a shame I'm not more artistic.</p>
<p>Anyone out there have some mad artistic skills that would like to team up with me?</p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>
