Renamed to objectForKey: and setObject:forKey: as the implementation intends.</font></li>    <li><font face="Courier New">&quot;Block&quot; generally changed to CompletionHandler, blocks should be named after their intention, with fallback to &quot;block&quot; only for truly generic functionality such as collection enumerations.</font></li>    <li><font face="Courier New">Use of the verb &quot;get&quot; changed to &quot;fetch&quot;. &quot;Get&quot; is by convention reserved for out-arguments of methods.</font></li>    <li><font face="Courier New">Base64 helper converted to proper categories on NSString and NSData, this is a pattern that should have been applied more broadly.</font> </li> </ul>  <p>You can see the full <a href="https://github.com/microsoft-dpe/watoolkitios-lib/pull/1" target="_blank">pull request</a> here (along with our commentary).</p>  <p>Thank you for your contributions, <a href="http://www.peylow.se/" target="_blank">Fredrik</a>.&#160; Keep them coming!</p>
