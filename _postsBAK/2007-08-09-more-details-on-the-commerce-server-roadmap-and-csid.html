<p>Earlier today I learned about the new <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/2007/08/08/ExcitingCommerceServerNews.aspx">partnership between Microsoft and Cactus Commerce</a>&nbsp;through some press releases, but finally some official announcements come from the Commerce Server product team.</p> <p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rdonovan/default.aspx">Ryan Donovan</a> has blogged on both the Commerce Server product roadmap and the new Commerce Server Information Desk (CSID) program:&nbsp;<a title="http://blogs.msdn.com/commerce/archive/2007/08/08/official-announcements-commerce-server-product-roadmap-information-desk-program.aspx" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/commerce/archive/2007/08/08/official-announcements-commerce-server-product-roadmap-information-desk-program.aspx">Official Announcements: Commerce Server Product Roadmap &amp; Information Desk Program</a>.&nbsp; Here are some of the things I took away from the post:</p> <ul> <li>Technology</li> <ul> <li>Commerce Server "7" (codename) - next major version of Commerce Server, targeted for mid-2000</li> <li>Commerce Server 2007 accelerators - <em>a la carte</em> additions that you can add to your CS 2007 implementations</li> <ul> <li>Technology integration - MOSS 2007, Dynamics, Live services, and Silverlight (wow!)</li> <li>Vertical scenarios - Merchandise/retail, apparel, electronics, digital downloads, and hospitality</li></ul> <li>Pricing, licensing, packaging, and naming are all TBD</li></ul> <li>Resources and support</li> <ul> <li>Commerce Server Information Desk (CSID) program</li> <li>Aims "to provide top quality pre- and post-sales engagement support"</li> <li>Product-group managed program immediately available through <a href="mailto:csid@microsoft.com">csid@microsoft.com</a></li></ul></ul> <p>I am very excited about both of these announcements.&nbsp; It's exciting to hear that the product team is plugging away at the next version of Commerce Server, and I can't wait to get my hands on the accelerators!&nbsp; I've wanted this for a long time now - <u>true integration</u> to other MS products as well as the ability to specifically <u>target certain industries</u>.</p> <p>My guess is that these accelerates are/were the intellectual property (IP) of <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/ct.ashx?id=916ea1c4-2913-47a1-9838-bf5515746e2a&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cactuscommerce.com%2fhome%2fdefault_e.asp">Cactus Commerce</a>, and that this new partnership has allowed Microsoft to bundle them into the product.&nbsp; <em>Can anyone validate or invalidate this statement?</em></p> <p>Ryan also posted an announcement on his personal MSDN blog: <a title="http://blogs.msdn.com/rdonovan/archive/2007/08/08/in-depth-commerce-server-product-roadmap-information-desk-program-announcement.aspx" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rdonovan/archive/2007/08/08/in-depth-commerce-server-product-roadmap-information-desk-program-announcement.aspx">In-Depth: Commerce Server Product Roadmap&nbsp;&amp; Information Desk Program Announcement</a>.&nbsp; Here are some of the additional <em>nuggets</em> I took away from his post:</p> <ul> <li>CS 2007 is now a year old! (<em>time flies ...</em>)</li> <li>Commerce Server "7" will be the <em>seventh</em> major version of MS's e-commerce platform</li> <li>Features</li> <ul> <li>Migration from CS 2007</li> <li>Commerce Foundation 3.0</li> <ul> <li>An <strong>all-managed foundation </strong>(<em>finally!</em>)</li> <li>A consistent programming model</li> <li>2-tier and 3-tier/web-service support for runtime and management services</li></ul> <li><em>Commerce-at-Your-Fingertips</em></li> <ul> <li>It's not just about the Web site</li> <li>Kiosks, mobility, and in-store integrations (<em>wow!</em>)</li></ul> <li>Lifestyle Commerce</li> <ul> <li>Social networking (<em>man, this would be SO handy right now ...</em>)</li> <li>Personalization</li> <li>"... targeted marketing across all channels with predictive analytics to measure the results and make adjustments ..." (<em>artificial intelligence?</em>)</li></ul></ul> <li>"... long-term arrangement with Cactus Commerce ... as the new preferred joint development and go-to-market partner for Commerce Server."</li> <ul> <li>MS Partners and customers can leverage Cactus' experience and expertise</li> <li>Working along with the product group</li></ul></ul> <p>Great stuff!&nbsp; The features that will come in Commerce Server "7" look to be outstanding!</p> <p>While I am happy to hear about Microsoft's joint venture with Cactus, I do have <u>some questions</u> regarding Cactus as the new "go-to-market" partner ...</p> <ul> <li>What does this actually mean to us (i.e. Microsoft partners)?&nbsp; How exactly can we leverage their expertise?</li> <li>While I've never consider us&nbsp;to be in competition with Cactus (different markets), it does seem strange that we may compete against Cactus for solutions and services yet will rely on them for sales and delivery support.&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this going to work?</li> <li>&nbsp;Who's really at the helm?&nbsp; Microsoft, or Cactus? (<em>this is asked facetiously ... &lt;grin&gt;</em>)</li></ul> <p>Again, it's all <strong>good stuff</strong>.&nbsp; I think the partnership is really going to drive things forward.&nbsp; It's a great time to be involved with Commerce Server!</p>
