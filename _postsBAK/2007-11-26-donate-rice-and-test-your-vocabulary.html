<p>I learned about the <a href="http://www.freerice.com/index.php">FreeRice</a> program from <a href="http://duckdown.blogspot.com/2007/11/have-you-heard-of-free-rice-program.html">James McGovern's blog post</a>.&nbsp; Not only does it appear to be a worthwhile program, but the it was fun to test my vocabulary.</p>

<p>I stopped after providing 500 grains of rice.&nbsp; I realized that my 500 grains wouldn't make a difference unless I also spread the word.&nbsp; So please, dear reader, take a moment and <a href="http://www.freerice.com/index.php">test your own vocabulary</a>!</p>
