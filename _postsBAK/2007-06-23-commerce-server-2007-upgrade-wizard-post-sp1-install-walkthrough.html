<p>In my previous post, I detailed the process for <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/PermaLink,guid,3e9bb1c9-4c0f-4468-af92-68ecf4db73d7.aspx" target="_blank">installing the Commerce Server 2007 SP1</a>.&nbsp; In this post, I have created a walkthrough for the Commerce Server 2007 Upgrade Wizard.&nbsp; The upgrade wizard should be run for all of your Commerce Server 2007 sites immediately after you have installed SP1.&nbsp; So, before you begin this process, be sure you have successfully installed SP1.</p> <p>(Note: I created this walkthrough, along with verbose screen shots and text, largely for documentation I am delivering to clients.&nbsp; Please feel free to use these screen shots and/or text for your own documentation.)</p> <p>A couple comments based on my experience installing SP1 and upgrading through the wizard:</p> <ul> <li>Immediately upgrade all of your Commerce Server 2007 sites.&nbsp; Do not reboot your machine before you run the Upgrade Wizard.  <li>Make sure SQL Server 2005 is running with the appropriate built-in account.&nbsp; For example, when I initially installed SP1 my SQL Server 2005&nbsp;instance ran as "Local System".&nbsp; However, post install, I had to switch the built-in account to "Network Service" for SQL Server 2005 to start-up properly.&nbsp; I will write a separate post about some issues I had the first time installing SP1.</li></ul> <p>That said,&nbsp;here's the process for using the Upgrade Wizard to upgrade your Commerce Server 2007 sites.</p> <ol> <li>Launch the Upgrade Wizard.&nbsp; You can launch this application automatically after installing SP1 or by running the Upgrade Wizard (Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; Microsoft Commerce Server 2007 -&gt; Tools -&gt; Upgrade Wizard).&nbsp; Click Next to begin.<br /><br /><img height="423" alt="CS 2007 Upgrade Wizard: Welcome" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/8f31dba0b1b5_A611/Upgrade1_1.gif" width="558"> <br /></li> <li>On the Select Options screen, specify the log file path.&nbsp;
