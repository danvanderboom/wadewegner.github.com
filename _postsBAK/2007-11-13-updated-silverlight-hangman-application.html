<p>It only took me two or three months, but I finally updated my <a href="http://apps.wadewegner.com/hangman/default.aspx" target=_blank>Silverlight Hangman application</a>.&nbsp; It was originally written an earlier version of Silverlight 1.1 alpha, and I hadn't taken the time to update it.</p>
<p>The only things I had to do was switch out the Silverlight.js file and change the value of "Hidden" to "Collapsed" for the "Visibility" property of objects.&nbsp; Otherwise I was able to use the same files in the Beta 2 version of Visual Studio 2008.</p>
<p>(Darn, I bet when Visual Studio 2008 is released soon I'll have to update it again!&nbsp; Oh well!)</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
