<p>Lately it seems that I have had to acquire a lot of hotfixes for Microsoft products.&nbsp; Unfortunately, most of the KB articles don't provide a link to the hotfix, but instead ask you to contact Microsoft Support (via phone) to acquire the hotfix.&nbsp; Kind of a pain!</p> <p>Fortunately, my friend <a href="http://blog.richfinn.net/">Rich Finn</a> just passed along this useful link:</p> <p><a title="https://support.microsoft.com/contactus2/emailcontact.aspx?scid=sw;en;1410&amp;WS=hotfix" href="https://support.microsoft.com/contactus2/emailcontact.aspx?scid=sw;en;1410&amp;WS=hotfix">Hotfix Request Web Submission Form</a></p> <p>Very useful ... no longer will I have to reach out an contact individual escalation engineers I've worked with in the past. &lt;sheepish grin&gt;</p>
