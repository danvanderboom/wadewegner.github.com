<p>Today I decided to install the x64 version of Windows Server 2008 EE w/ Hyper-V on my Dell D830 laptop.&#160; I will post about the experience later (it was awesome!); for now, I want to specifically mention how I was able to get the wireless working.</p>  <p>I should have done my due diligence prior to installing Windows Server 2008, but I like to live dangerously!&#160; After the installation was complete (which was simple and fast), I noticed that the wireless adapter was not installed.&#160; I tried to update the driver manually, specifically telling it to check the web, but the search didn't find anything.&#160; I also checked both the Intel and Dell web sites to no available&#8212;I couldn't find anything for Windows Server 2008 and my wireless adapter on either web site (which is not all that surprising, since I doubt many people try to install a server O/S on their laptop).</p>  <p>Discouraged, I did a quick search and found a post from my colleague <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/keithcombs/default.aspx">Keith Combs</a> discussing his experience <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/keithcombs/archive/2008/02/01/installing-windows-server-2008-ee-on-a-lenovo-thinkpad-t61p.aspx">installing Windows Server 2008 EE on his Lenovo laptop</a>.&#160; Amazingly, Lenovo laptops have the same Intel wireless adapter as the Dell; furthermore, Lenovo has also published the <a href="http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?sitestyle=lenovo&amp;lndocid=MIGR-67256">device drivers</a>!</p>  <p>To make a long story short (too late, I know), I was able to download and install the Lenovo drivers on my Dell.&#160; Thus far (it's been about two hours) everything seems to be working perfectly!</p>  <p>Gotta love OEM!</p>  <p>Hopefully this saves a poor soul from a couple hours of digging.&#160; Good luck!</p>
