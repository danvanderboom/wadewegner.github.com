<p>I have recently been scouring MSFT resources for information related to architecture and the role of enterprise architects, and I have found two resources that I wanted to highlight:</p>
<p><a title=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/default.aspx href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/default.aspx"><strong>MSDN Architecture Center</strong></a></p>
<p>This is a great central hub for architectural information related to MSFT technologies, platforms, and products.&nbsp; There are also a number of excellent architects that deal with topics such as <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/aa948857.aspx">service oriented architecture (SOA)</a>, <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/aa699384.aspx">Software + Services (S+S, SaaS)</a>, <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/aa973363.aspx">security</a>, <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/bb469938.aspx">enterprise architecture</a>, <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/bb404166.aspx">agile development</a>, and more.&nbsp; Additionally, it is tied into a number of great blog feeds by various architects in the MSFT community.</p>
<p><a title=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/arcjournal/default.aspx href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/arcjournal/default.aspx"><strong>The Microsoft Architecture Journal</strong></a></p>
<p>As an example, Journal 13 is focused on Software + Services (S+S).&nbsp; As such, topics include: <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/bb906065.aspx">The Internet Service Bus</a>, <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/bb906063.aspx">Project Astoria</a>, <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/bb906061.aspx">Implications of Software + Services Consumption for Enterprise IT</a>, <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/bb906060.aspx">Enterprise Mashups</a>, <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/bb906062.aspx">Microsoft Office as a Platform for Software + Services</a>, and <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/bb906059.aspx">A Planet Ruled by Software Architectures</a>.&nbsp; Additionally, it features profiles, such as the profile on <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/bb906064.aspx">Ray Ozzie</a> this month.</p>
<p>And the best part of it is that, after you register, you can get a <a href="https://www.msarchitecturejournal.com/Default.aspx">free subscription to the MSFT architecture journal</a>.</p>
<p>You can also subscribe to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/arcjournal/rss/rss.xml">RSS feed</a>.&nbsp; Good stuff!</p>
<p>As a side note, I'll admit that I need to find more resources like this that are not MSFT specific.&nbsp; While I believe MSFT does a great job of addressing architectural issues that are agnostic of platform and technology, I need to continue to diversify the helpings on my plate!</p>
<p>If any one has suggestions, please send them my way!</p>
