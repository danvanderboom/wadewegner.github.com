Note that when you specify your SQL Azure username, specify your user name as &quot;username@server&quot;. Also note that data migration only works on the latest release of SQL Azure (Server Location: South Central US).</li>    <li>Modified App.Config to allow you to specify your Options. For example: If you do not want to migrate data, you can turn this off by modifying the App.Config file and changing ScriptData to false.</li>    <li>Added a cancel button so that you can cancel while processing.</li>    <li>Added a scroll toggle so that during processing you can keep the control from scrolling down to the bottom.</li>    <li>Fixed an error in BCP command to allow the passing of the SQL Server instance name.</li>    <li>Added color to the SQL results to better identify error messages.</li> </ul>  <p>If you're using SQL Azure, go and grab the new version of the <a href="http://sqlazuremw.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">SQL Azure Migration Wizard</a>!&#160; For detailed instructions on how to use the wizard, take a look at the <a href="http://sqlazuremw.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=32334#DownloadId=86938" target="_blank">SQL Azure Migration Wizard whitepaper</a>.</p>
