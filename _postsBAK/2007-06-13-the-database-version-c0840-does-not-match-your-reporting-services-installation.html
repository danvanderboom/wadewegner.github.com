<p>As I was preparing a new virtual machine for Commerce Server 2007 (one capable of utilizing the Commerce Server Adapters with BizTalk Server 2006 and Data Warehousing), I ran into a problem when configuring SQL Server Reporting Services.</p>
<p>I had taken a virtual machine that I use as my base installation (e.g. Windows Server 2003 R2, IIS, .NET 2.0, Visual Studio 2005, and the SQL Server 2005 Database Engine) and was following the Commerce Server 2007 <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/3/a/4/3a46267f-9640-4623-86a1-c63bbfea9e1d/Installation%20and%20Configuration%20Guide%20for%20Microsoft%20Commerce%20Server%202007.html#Prepare_Install">Pre-install Requirements and Procedures</a> from the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=57268">Installation Guide</a> when I encoutered the following error:</p>
<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p><font face="Courier New">The database version (C.0.8.40) does not match your reporting services installation.&nbsp; You must upgrade your reporting services database.</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New">Couldn't generate the upgrade script.&nbsp; There is no upgrade script available for this version.</font></p></blockquote>
<p>Turns out that that I had installed Service Pack 2 after I originally installed the Database Engine but before I installed Reporting Services.&nbsp; Consequently, when I went to configure a reporting database under the Database Setup step it complained that the versions were incorrect.</p>
<p>To resolve the problem, I simply ran the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=d07219b2-1e23-49c8-8f0c-63fa18f26d3a&amp;DisplayLang=en">Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Service Pack 2</a> installation again, and updated the Reporting Services instance.&nbsp; This allowed me to finish the configuration of SQL Reporting Services without any problems.</p>
<p>A simple little problem, but one that had me baffled for a little while (it's probably just the sleep deprivation caused by <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/PermaLink,guid,7b293d04-a61d-4baa-a224-0f24639f4ecc.aspx">the little one</a>).</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>
