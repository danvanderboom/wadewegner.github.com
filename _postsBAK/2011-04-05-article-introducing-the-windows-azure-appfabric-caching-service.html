<p>I was excited to receive my MSDN Magazine in the mail this week, as an article written by myself and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/karandeep">Karandeep Anand</a>—a Principal Group Program Manager on the AppFabric team—was finally published.&#160; These things generally take a month or so from the time you finish writing them, which is often challenging in a services world.</p>  <p>You can now read this article online: <a title="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/gg983488.aspx" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/gg983488.aspx" target="_blank">Introducing the Windows Azure AppFabric Caching Service</a></p>  <p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/gg983488.aspx"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="clip_image001" border="0" alt="clip_image001" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2011/04/clip_image001.jpg" width="244" height="184" /></a></p>  <p>Don’t let the title deceive you – it’s not your typical “Introducing…” or “Getting Started” tutorial.&#160; We wanted to delve deeper, and included:</p>  <ul>   <li>Under the Hood</li>    <li>Architectural Guidance</li>    <li>Setup</li>    <li>Using Cache in Your App</li>    <li>What’s Next?</li> </ul>  <p>Karan and I are also giving a talk at MIX11 entitled <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/events/MIX/MIX11/SVC01">Build Fast Web Applications with Windows Azure AppFabric Caching</a> where we’ll not only build on foundational principals laid out in this article, but also show a lot of compelling demonstrations.</p>  <p>The best part is that you can start using the Caching service today as part of the Community Technology Preview (CTP).&#160; Sign up at: <a href="https://portal.appfabriclabs.com/">https://portal.appfabriclabs.com/</a>.</p>
