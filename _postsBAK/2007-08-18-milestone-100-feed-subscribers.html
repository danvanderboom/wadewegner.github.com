<p>I started blogging as a way of archiving tips-and-tricks I learn everyday so that I can go refer back to the post rather than having to constantly re-learn everything.&nbsp; I have also tried to document ways I have solved various problems and issues that I am confronted with while working with various technologies.&nbsp; I'll admit that, originally, this blog was a purely selfish endeavor - I wasn't motivated by any altruistic reasons, I simply wanted to have a way to archive things I've learned so that I could refer back to them.</p>
<p>Recently, though, this has all changed.&nbsp; I didn't realize how much satisfaction I'd receive from seeing the that other people are also finding value in my posts.&nbsp; As readership has increased, and I get more and more feedback from people that found a solution to their problem in one of my posts, I have tried to post better and more useful content.</p>

<p>I know that 100 feed subscribers&nbsp;is a small milestone (many of the blogs I subscriber to have thousands of subscribers), but nonetheless I am proud of the slow, organic growth I've seen in my feed subscribers and blog visitors.&nbsp; I don't try anything gimmicky - all I do is post content based on thing things I do everyday and the things I learn along the way.</p>
<p>I just thought I'd share my feed stats with you.&nbsp; It's neat (at least, <em>I think it is</em>) to see the growth of subscribers since the day I started tracking them.&nbsp; Here are my FeedBurner stats:</p>

<p>At the same time, traffic to the blog itself has continued to grow.&nbsp; Here are stats from Google over the same period:</p>
