<p>I just recently started a new BizTalk Server 2006 project in which I created a custom pipeline component to assist in the compression and decompression of messages.&nbsp; The plan is to have a receive location monitor a folder via the File adapter, and when a zip file is uploaded via FTP from a 3rrd party process, the receive location will use the custom pipeline component , via a receive pipeline, to decompress the file and publish the message to the MessageBox.&nbsp; Pretty slick!</p> <blockquote> <p><em>See the WingtipToys solution in the SDK folder for a great heads-start to creating a compression / decompression pipeline component.&nbsp; You can find this solution in the following folder: C:Program FilesMicrosoft BizTalk Server 2006SDKScenariosPM.</em></p></blockquote> <p>So, to get this rolling, I added a C# project to my BizTalk solution.&nbsp; There are few things I configure on these C# library projects, as I need to utilize the output assembly in my Pipelines&nbsp;BizTalk project.</p> <ol> <li>Set the build output path to the following location (for the Debug configuration): C:Program FilesMicrosoft BizTalk Server 2006Pipeline Components.&nbsp; This way, every time the project is built, the debug assembly is placed in the Pipeline Components folder.&nbsp; From here, you can then reference the pipeline component appropriate through both Visual Studio 2005 (for your receive pipeline) and when you deploy it to BizTalk Server.<br /></li> <li>Uncheck the "Build" checkbox, for the C# library project, in the Solution Configuration.&nbsp; This way, when you rebuild or deploy the solution, the C# library project isn't also rebuilt.&nbsp; The reason is that you will most likely get errors or warnings indicating that the file is in use, and cannot be rebuilt.&nbsp; This is fine - you can simply do this manually.</li></ol> <p>Having made these changes, you now have a pretty flexible setup for moving forward.</p> <p>When you reference the custom pipeline component assembly, you'll want to reference the assembly that has been built in the C:Program FilesMicrosoft BizTalk Server 2006Pipeline Components folder.&nbsp; This way, when you deploy your receive or send pipelines, BizTalk will continue to reference the same assembly.</p> <p>However, having referenced this assembly, you will see these warnings the next time you build your solution:</p> <blockquote> <p><font face="Courier New">------ Build started: Project: BizTalkApp, Configuration: Development .NET ------<br />Updating references...<br />The dependency 'Microsoft.BizTalk.Tracing' could not be found.<br />The dependency 'Microsoft.BizTalk.Bam.EventObservation' could not be found.<br />The dependency 'Microsoft.BizTalk.Streaming' could not be found.<br />The dependency 'Microsoft.BizTalk.XPathReader' could not be found.<br />Performing main compilation...</font></p></blockquote> <p>While these warnings are harmless, they are annoying.&nbsp; In order to "suppress" these warnings, select the referenced custom pipeline component assembly, and set Copy Local from True to False.&nbsp; Once you do this, these warnings will disappear.</p> <p>I hope this helps!</p>
