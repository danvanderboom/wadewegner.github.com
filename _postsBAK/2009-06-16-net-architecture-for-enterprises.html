Yesterday I gave a talk on .NET architecture to a very large customer here in Illinois (in case you’re interested, I had to drive down to Bloomington, IL. to visit them).  The description of the talk was pretty bland – “Overview of application architecture for medium to large scale applications.” – so I tried to spice it up a bit.  Here’s the presentation:
<div id="__ss_1592240" style="text-align: left; width: 425px;"><a style="margin: 12px 0px 3px; display: block; font: 14px helvetica,arial,sans-serif; text-decoration: underline" title=".NET Architecture for Enterprises" href="http://www.slideshare.net/wwegner/net-architecture-for-enterprises?type=powerpoint">.NET Architecture for Enterprises</a><object width="425" height="355" data="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=enterprise-netarchitecture-090616104658-phpapp01&amp;rel=0&amp;stripped_title=net-architecture-for-enterprises" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=enterprise-netarchitecture-090616104658-phpapp01&amp;rel=0&amp;stripped_title=net-architecture-for-enterprises" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></div>
Ultimately, my goal in this talk was to address the following:
<ul>
	<li>Provide an introduction to software architecture – i.e. the practice of architecture, the role of an architect, architecture patterns &amp; anti-patterns, methodologies, and the like – to developers that typically live in a world of software implementation.</li>
	<li>Explore the practical aspects of applying architectural practices in .NET.</li>
</ul>
I had a lot of fun preparing for this talk, and I sincerely hope that the audience found it valuable.  I hope to eventually record this as a webcast and then break off into more specific topics that dig into different areas.
