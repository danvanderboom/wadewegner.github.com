<p>I was writing a Silverlight application today, when I came across the following error when trying to invoke a web service method from my Silverlight project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Courier New">"Error invoking service"</font></p></blockquote>
<p>After digging around a little bit, I noticed the following above my web method:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Courier New">// To allow this Web Service to be called from script, using ASP.NET AJAX, uncomment the following line. <br />// [System.Web.Script.Services.ScriptService]</font></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://11011.net/software/vspaste"></a>"Ahh!" I said, as I uncommented the class attribute.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when I tried to compile I was told:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Courier New">The type or namespace name 'Script' does not exist in the namespace System.Web' (are you missing an assembly reference?)</font></p></blockquote>
<p>So, I went to "Add Reference", added "System.Web.Extensions" to my project, and now it compiles!&nbsp; And, after testing my web service call from my Silverlight project, the data from the web services&nbsp;is returned to my Silverlight project as expected.</p>
<p>Nice!</p>
