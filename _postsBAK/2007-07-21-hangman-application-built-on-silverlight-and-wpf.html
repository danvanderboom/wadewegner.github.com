<p>Unfortunately I don't have&nbsp;enough time at the moment to write-up a full post that outlines how this works (we have friends coming over for dinner), but I wanted to at least share my very first attempt at a Silverlight and&nbsp;WPF web application.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://apps.wadewegner.com/hangman/"><strong>Hangman</strong></a>!</p>
<p>It's a pretty slick (albeit graphically retarded) Silverlight application.&nbsp; It uses <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/eula.aspx?id=e2c1a44f-0b5c-face-28c8-08a26f2e0b3c">Microsoft Silverlight 1.1 Alpha</a> (for Windows), and I built it on the work I did <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/2007/07/16/DevisingAStrategyToConsistentlyWinHangmanPartI.aspx">devising a strategy to (consistently) win&nbsp;hangman</a>.</p>

<p>I plan to eventually write a post explaining exactly how I setup my development environment, how the technology within this application functions, and I'll post the source code (once I refactor it).</p>
<p>What do you think?&nbsp; Have you built any Silverlight applications?</p>
