I am really excited about <a href="http://www.mobilethisdeveloper.com/" target="_blank">The Race to Market Challenge</a>, sponsored by the Windows Mobile team.  Nothing motivates me like a challenge that promises great prizes and glory - especially when the prize is a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/" target="_blank">Microsoft Surface</a>!

If that's not enough to get you pumped up about developing a killer application, what will?

I've decided to build a mobile application myself (two, actually), and consequently needed to make sure that I had my development environment setup appropriately.  There are quite a few steps required in order to prepare your machine for Windows Mobile development, but it's not too bad.
<blockquote>I am running Windows 7 RTM 64 bit with Visual Studio 2008 Team Suite.  Your mileage may vary if you're running a different O/S or version of Visual Studio.  That said, I strongly recommend you upgrade to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/default.aspx" target="_blank">Windows 7</a> and insist on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/teamsystem/default.mspx" target="_blank">Team Suite</a> - there are no substitutes for good tools.</blockquote>
Here are the steps I took in order to setup my machine:
<ol>
	<li>Download and install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=4F68EB56-7825-43B2-AC89-2030ED98ED95&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">Microsoft Windows Mobile Device Center 6.1 Driver for Windows Vista (64-bit)</a>.  At the moment it doesn't appear as if there's a specific version for Windows 7.  This Windows Vista version seems to work just fine.</li>
	<li>Download the Windows Mobile 6 SDKs and 6.5 tool kit.  Be sure and note the different terminology for the different phones - evidently there are distinctions between Windows Mobile Standard (previously Windows Mobile for Smartphone) and Windows Mobile Professional (previously Windows Mobile for Pocket PC).�
<ul>
	<li>Install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=06111a3a-a651-4745-88ef-3d48091a390b&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">Windows Mobile 6 Professional and Standard Software Development Kits Refresh</a>.</li>
	<li>Install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=20686a1d-97a8-4f80-bc6a-ae010e085a6e" target="_blank">Windows Mobile 6.5 Developer Tool Kit</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>I also wanted to install the Mobile Applications Blocks from patterns &amp; practices.
<ul>
	<li>First install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=FCE9ABBF-F807-45D6-A457-AB5615001C8F&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">SQL Server Compact 3.5 SP1 for Windows Mobile</a>.  This is required for using the Data Access Block, Disconnected Agent, and Subscription Block.</li>
	<li>Install the <a href="http://mobile.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">Mobile Application Blocks</a> through the <a href="http://mobile.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=27708" target="_blank">Community Drop Installer (05-21-2009)</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>I am also a big fan of reference applications, and using them to evaluate best practices when developing on a new platform.  Consequently, I wanted to get the following two solution accelerators for Windows Mobile.
<ul>
	<li>Install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=ACB764DF-EF79-4B96-A47F-6C7D916473E5&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">Microsoft Windows Mobile 6 Consumer Solution Accelerator</a>.  This is a showcase mobile consumer application that assists a user traveling to a meeting.  Definitely worth reviewing to harness best practices.</li>
	<li>Install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=428E4C3D-64AD-4A3D-85D2-E711ABC87F04&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">Windows Mobile Line of Business Solution Accelerator 2008</a>.  This is a supply chain application that uses the .NET Compact Framework 3.5, SQL Server Compact 3.5, and has a great deal of useful documentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
A lengthy process, but not too difficult.

Once I completed the setup, I wanted to confirm that I could actually build and emulate an application.  I decided to do this very quickly by creating a "Hello Windows Mobile!" application and deploy to one of the Windows Mobile 6.5 emulators.

Here are the steps I took:
<ol>
	<li>You need to start a device emulator so that you have something to which you can deploy the application.  Run the Device Emulator Manager by selecting <strong>Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; Windows Mobile 6 SDK -&gt; Tools -&gt; Device Emulator Manager</strong>.
<ul>
	<li>I Create a new smart device project.  This will create a new project and give you a blank windows mobile form.</li>
	<li>Open up Visual Studio, and click <strong>File -&gt; New -&gt; Project</strong>.</li>
	<li>Select <strong>Visual C# -&gt; Smart Device -&gt; Smart Device Project</strong>.  Name it whatever you like.</li>
	<li>From the New Smart Device Project screen select "Windows Mobile 6 Professional SDK" for your target platform and choose "Device Application".</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>From the Toolbox, drag a Label control onto the form and change the text to "Hello Windows Mobile!"</li>
	<li>Debug the project by clicking F5 (or <strong>Debug -&gt; Start Debugging</strong>).
<ul>
	<li>You will be prompted to choose an emulator.  I chose the USA Windows Mobile 6.5 Professional VGA Emulator under <strong>Datastore -&gt; Windows Mobile 6 Professional SDK</strong>.</li>
	<li>Here's what it looks like - very cool:

<a href="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2009/09/image11.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2009/09/image_thumb1.png" border="0" alt="image" width="147" height="240" /></a></li>
	<li>After a few moments, your applications will get deployed to the device.  It may take a few minutes the first time as all the necessary pieces are deployed.  Once it has finished, you should see your application deployed.  It will look like this:

<a href="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2009/09/image12.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/2009/09/image_thumb2.png" border="0" alt="image" width="150" height="244" /></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>When you close the emulator, go ahead and have it save the state.  This will speed things up when you go to deploy the next time.</li>
</ol>
In the end, it's really exciting to have a fully functional development environment that can target all the Windows Mobile 6.X platforms.  Lots of potential for building applications that have a huge install base!

I really hope that you found this useful.  I strongly encourage you to sign up for the <a href="http://www.mobilethisdeveloper.com/" target="_blank">Race to Market Challenge</a> and start building some great applications.
