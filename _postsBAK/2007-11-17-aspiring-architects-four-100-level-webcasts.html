<p>I only recently noticed a four-part series of MSFT webcasts focused on aspiring architects, hosted by Mohammad Akif and Dave Remmer.&nbsp; I found these links after visiting the blog of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/hanuk/default.aspx">Hanu Kommalapati</a>, an MSFT architect evangelist.&nbsp; He links to the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/hanuk/archive/2007/04/25/webcasts-for-aspiring-architects.aspx">aspiring architects webcasts</a> himself, as well as <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mohammadakif/">Mohammad's blog</a>.</p>
<p>Here are links to the webcasts, as well as some high-level notes on the various topics discussed.</p>
<p>Note: you may think that these webcasts would focus on architecture from the MSFT perspective, but really the presenters do a great job of staying mostly agnostic to technology and platform.</p>

<p>I hope this helps!</p>
