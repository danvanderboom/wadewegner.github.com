<p>I was able to use the XML sample documents that come with eConnect&nbsp;(C:Program FilesMicrosoft Great PlainseConnect9XML Sample DocumentsIncoming) to write some test data into my GP database using the eConnect 9.0 adapters for BizTalk Server 2006.&nbsp; I setup a test environment using the TWO database for Great Plains, and through the adapter was able to insert data.&nbsp; Feeling that I had made some good progress, I shutdown my machine (they are all virtualized environments) and went home for the night.</p>
<p>When I started everything up the next day I tried to reproduce this behavior so that I could move on with my integration.&nbsp; However, every time I tried to write the document into GP through the adapter, I got the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font face="Courier New">Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error<br />Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;BizTalk DW Reporting<br />Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1000<br />Description:&nbsp;&nbsp; Faulting application btsntsvc.exe, version 3.5.1602.0, stamp 4410e6b9, faulting module kernel32.dll, version 5.2.3790.4062, stamp 46264680, debug? 0, fault address 0x0000bee7. </font></p></blockquote>
<p>This had me stumped for a little while.&nbsp; I decided to use a useful tool&nbsp;I received from Microsoft called the Direct Document Sender.NET (I've attached the file at the bottom of this post) to try and diagnose the problem.&nbsp; This tool allows you to post an XML document directly to eConnect so that you can test out the functionality without any 3rd party application (e.g. BizTalk Server).
<p>Using this application, I tried to post the XML file again.&nbsp; This time I received a much more useful&nbsp;error:
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Courier New">System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x8000401A): The server process could not be started because the configured identity is incorrect.&nbsp; Check the username and password.</font> </p></blockquote>
<p>Aha!&nbsp; This was a much more useful error!
<p>I opened up Component Services (Start --&gt; Administrative Tools --&gt; Component Services), and browsed to Computers --&gt; My Computer --&gt; COM+ Applications --&gt; <strong>eConnect 9 for Great Plains</strong>.&nbsp; The Microsoft Great Plains eConnect Version 9 COM Plus Package has a tab entitled <strong>Identity</strong> which allows you to define the user account under which the application runs.&nbsp; Turns out that <em>somehow</em> my account was switched from the user I specified at installation to the interactive user system account:
<p><a href="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/BizTalkprocesscrashingwitheConnect9adapt_8E58/Component.gif" atomicselection="true"><img height=466 alt=Component src="http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/BizTalkprocesscrashingwitheConnect9adapt_8E58/Component_thumb.gif" width=404 border=0></a>
<p>And this was the root cause of my problem.&nbsp; eConnect requires integrated security and uses the user specified in this identity tab to access the GP database.&nbsp; Consequently, the user specified must have access to the appropriate database on the GP server and also be a part of the DYNGRP role.</p>
<p>So, I went ahead and added my user to the DYNGRP role, made sure it had the appropriate access, and then updated account used by the COM+ package:</p>

<p>Having made these changes, I tested with the Document Sender.NET application - worked the first time!&nbsp; Confidently I tested with BizTalk, and sure enough everything started to work!</p>
<p>I'm not sure why it initially worked and then stopped working after I restarted the machines.&nbsp; I'm not sure if the account credentials changed or if something else was happening the first time.&nbsp; All I know is that you have to use an appropriate user that has access to the database and is a member of the appropriate role, otherwise you'll get the errors I listed above.</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>
