<a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/">Wade Wegner</a> has nearly fifteen years of experience with professional software engineering and has filled various roles from software developer to architect to technology evangelist. Wade first started programming in middle school by writing Pascal-based scripts for VT220 telnet clients that automatically played (and leveled) characters in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUDs</a>. Since then he’s worked on increasingly more complex solutions (if not as fun) including large-scale commerce implementations, low-latency distributed messaging systems, and cloud-based Monte Carlo simulations.

Wade is currently the CTO at <a href="http://www.aditi.com/" target="_blank">Aditi Technologies</a>, where he is responsible for driving Aditi's technical strategy and ensuring continuous innovation on behalf of its customers.

Prior to joining Aditi, Wade held several roles in Microsoft, most recently leading Technical Evangelism for Windows Azure. In this capacity, Wade coordinated across engineering, marketing, sales, and field teams in order to drive the adoption of Windows Azure. Wade was responsible for the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8396">Windows Azure Training Kit</a> and built the Windows Azure Toolkits for Devices (<a href="http://watwp.codeplex.com/">Windows Phone</a>, <a href="http://watwindows8.codeplex.com/">Windows 8</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure-Toolkits/wa-toolkit-ios">iOS</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure-Toolkits/wa-toolkit-android">Android</a>). Wade also worked as a software architect, leading architectural design sessions, proof-of-concepts, and engagements with some of Microsoft’s largest customers. Perhaps the most fun Wade had was a host on the weekly Channel 9 show <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/cloud+cover">Cloud Cover</a> with Steve Marx.

Prior to Microsoft Wade was the Director of Microsoft Technologies at Statera—a Microsoft NSI partner—where he filled a number of roles, including technical readiness &amp; execution, lead architect and developer on customer engagements, pre-sales support, and managing the Microsoft partnership.

Wade is still actively involved in the developer community and frequently speaks at events such as TechEd, MIX, PDC, and BUILD.

Outside of work, Wade is an aspiring brew master. If you care to hear about his brewing (and tasting) adventures you can <a href="http://twitter.com/wadewegner">follow him on Twitter</a> or join him as he brews on the weekend!
