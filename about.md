I have more than fifteen years of experience with professional software engineering and have filled various roles from software developer to architect to technology evangelist. I first started programming in middle school by writing Pascal-based scripts for VT220 telnet clients that automatically played (and leveled) characters in [MUDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD). Since then I've worked on increasingly more complex solutions (if not as fun) including large-scale commerce implementations, low-latency distributed messaging systems, and cloud-based Monte Carlo simulations.

I am currently a Senior Director at salesforce.com, focusing on architects and developers as a technical evangelist. I focus on language SDKs and developer tools for integration with salesforce.com through our APIs. In addition to building SDKs such as the [Salesforce Toolkits for .NET](http://www.wadewegner.com/2014/01/announcing-the-salesforce-toolkits-for-net/), I spend a lot of time building IoT prototypes with sensors, wearable technology, and anything else that captures large amounts of data and needs ways to aggregate and generate reports.

Prior to salesforce.com, I was CTO at [Aditi Technologies](http://www.aditi.com/), responsible for driving Aditi's technical strategy and product engineering. In addition to building a robust IP strategy across our consulting organization, I led the creation of two developer services: [Brewmaster](http://brewmaster.aditicloud.com/), which automates the provisioning and deployment of advanced application topologies in Microsoft Azure (e.g. similar to "cloud formation" for AWS), and [Scheduler](http://www.aditicloud.com/), a flexible developer service providing full CRON capabilities to numerous endpoints.

I held several roles in Microsoft, most recently leading Technical Evangelism for Windows Azure. In this capacity, I coordinated across engineering, marketing, sales, and field teams in order to drive the adoption of Windows Azure. I was responsible for the [Windows Azure Training Kit](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8396) and built the Windows Azure Toolkits for Devices ([Windows Phone](http://watwp.codeplex.com/), [Windows 8](http://watwindows8.codeplex.com/), [iOS](https://github.com/WindowsAzure-Toolkits/wa-toolkit-ios), and [Android](https://github.com/WindowsAzure-Toolkits/wa-toolkit-android)). I also worked as a software architect, leading architectural design sessions, proof-of-concepts, and engagements with some of Microsoftâ€™s largest customers. Perhaps the most fun I had was as a host on the weekly Channel 9 show [Cloud Cover](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/cloud+cover) with Steve Marx.

I am still actively involved in the developer community and frequently speak at events such as TechEd, BUILD, and ThatConference.

Outside of work, I am an aspiring brew master. If you care to hear about my brewing (and tasting) adventures you can [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/wadewegner) or join me sometime as I brew on the weekend!
